# Date of Retrospective: 10/13/21

* Led by: Wyatt
* Present: Leon, Richard, Royce, Ana, Wyatt, Sara
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

* a goal: We would like to get better at communicating
* a change: We will plan to try and meet at least once outside of class per week, and check our slack channel more often
* a measurement: If we are actually meeting outside of class each week and if there is more activity in the slack channel, we know that the change has been applied

## Optional

* Make sure to continue to learn more about the technologies we are using (React Native, SQL, etc...)


## Retro Assessment

* We used the start/stop/continue retro outline
* We had some great discussions during this retrospective about communicating more and we got a good idea of where everyone's head is at with regard to the first few weeks of class
* I would advise that you make sure everyone gets an opportunity to speak and to make sure you devise a way for everyone to voice their concerns on aspects of the group and project itself.
