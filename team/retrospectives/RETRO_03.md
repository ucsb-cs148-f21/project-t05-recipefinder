# Retro #3 11/17/21

* Led by: Richard Rao
* Present: Ana, Sara, Richard, Wyatt, Royce, Leon
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

* a goal: We would like to further improve our communication with peers and mentors and try to implement deadlines for features in order to better measure productivity.
* a change: Communicate with TA/Prof if stuck on an issue and possibly assign an informal due date/check in to tasks where members have to demonstrate or provide an update on their progress.
* a measurement: See if the development of app progresses faster and smoother(less stuck time) and check if we are able to track progress more effectively
## Optional

* Remeber sunk cost fallacy, some features may not be reasonable to implement.

## Retro Assessment

* As a team, we covered the areas where we were satisfied in terms of progress on the project but we also went over issues that we've noticed since the last retro and came up with possible solutions
* The discussion was very efficient and the team was able to clear up confusions and focus on the next steps.
* As a team, I believe the retros helped noticeably increase our communication through slack and in person and in general, just gives the team a direction/goal to improve.
