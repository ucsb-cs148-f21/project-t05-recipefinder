## Retro Assessment

* We focused on what went well and what went wrong and how we can improve for the next sprint
* Went very well, discussion was thorough and we all gained a consensus on the next priority.
* Be diligent and thorough about all the topics you plan to cover. Leave no stone unturned.

# Retro #2 10/29/21 

* Led by: Royce Nguyen  
* Present: Ana, Sara, Leon, Richard, Royce, Wyatt

* Our retro 2 experiment was to have everyone share one thing that went well and one thing that didn't go as well.
* Our metric is to compare how progress going forward vs the "things" that we felt did not go well.
* We found this retrospective to be very insightful becuase the whole team can share their views.

## Action item

* a goal: identify something the team wants to get better at
* a change: identify one thing that the team will change about how it works together
* a measurement: identify at least one way to measure whether the change helped the team acheive the goal, or move closer to it.

##One thing that went well
* We were able to complete a simple user interface to work with the API
* We were able to integrate the frontend and database
* We were able to set up API methods that can interact with database
* We were able to add a tab handler and navigate to separate pages

##One thing that we can improve on
* Adding more features and implementing a more nice looking interface
* Figure out a better way to query the data
* Improve API features so we can check if user inputs are correct or not
* Creating a login/profile page and allow users to customize their preferences
