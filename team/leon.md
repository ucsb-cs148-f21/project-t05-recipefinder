#Introduction
Hi, my namne is Leon Feng. I am a third year Computer Science major, and I am looking forward to develop a mobile app over the course of cs148 with my teammates. 

#Ideas
The idea about this project is that users can input whatever ingredients they have at hands, and our app will return a list of recipes that they can potentially use, and I think I personally want to add some filters as a part of the search function so that it also narrows down receipes in case users deem it necessary. Of course, more idea will come up later.
