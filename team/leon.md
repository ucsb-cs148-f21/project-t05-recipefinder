Hi, my namne is Leon Feng. I am a third year Computer Science major, and I am looking forward to develop a mobile app over the course of cs148 with my teammates. 

The idea about this project is that users can input whatever ingredients they have at hands, and our app will return a list of recipes that they can potentially use, and I think I personally want to add some filters as a part of the search function so that it also narrows down receipes in case users deem it necessary. Of course, more idea will come up later.
