##Introduction

My name is Ana Saldana, and I am a CS major. I am looking foward to develping a mobile app over this full course.

##Ideas
The idea for this project is to create a mobile app that allows the user to check/list the items in their pantry from that the app suggests recipes that used those products.

Some other functionalities that can be added are checklists so the user can input the items that they already used or will add to the pantry, checker for prices and where to get the best deals for a product, and possibly reminders for when a product/item is about to expired.
