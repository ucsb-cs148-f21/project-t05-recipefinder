## Action item

* a goal: identify something the team wants to get better at
* a change: identify one thing that the team will change about how it works together
* a measurement: identify at least one way to measure whether the change helped the team acheive the goal, or move closer to it.

##One thing that went well
* We were able to complete a simple user interface to work with the API
* We were able to integrate the frontend and database
* We were able to set up API methods that can interact with database
* We were able to add a tab handler and navigate to separate pages

##One thing that we can improve on
* Adding more features and implementing a more nice looking interface
* Figure out a better way to query the data
* Improve API features so we can check if user inputs are correct or not
* Creating a login/profile page and allow users to customize their preferences
