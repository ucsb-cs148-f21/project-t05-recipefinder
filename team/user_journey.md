# USER JOURNEY

The user comes with the goal of finding a recipe of a dish they would like to create, but they lack experience in the kitchen or a cookbook to come up with one.

The user will install our app

Our app fills this gap by searching through a database of recipes given the ingredients the user has

The user can view the recipe in the app and follow it step by step

The user can then rate, favorite, or block recipes.

The app can also recommend recipes based on types of dishes they like, or even tell a user if food is expiring soon based on more data the user gives us.
