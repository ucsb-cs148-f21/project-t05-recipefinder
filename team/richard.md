#Introduction
Hi my name is Richard Rao and I'm a 3rd year CS major. I'm looking forward to working on this recipe finding mobile app.

#Project Ideas
For this project, we will create a mobile app that allows users to input whatever ingredients they have on hand or in their pantry and the app would provide reciples that can be made.
There are multiple ways for us to expand the functions of this app such as including recipes where not all but most of the ingredients are in stock or providing services where they can obtain missing
ingredients for the best prices. The users will be able to update the ingredients on hand and the app can keep track of it.
