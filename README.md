# Tech Stack
We plan on using React Native to create this app

## Project Plan

The purpose of the app is to provide recipe suuggestions according to the ingredients the user inputs or searches. 


## User Roles
1. Users that look up recipes based on their ingredients/product input
2. Admins that can upload new recipes to the system
