Nothing I tried online came close to this and I guess the secret is the right kind of rice, the right rice/water ratio and of course, plenty of butter and oil! Find yourself a good Lebanese yogurt marinade, grill some meats, and get a hold of some hummus. If you're from Southeast Michigan or anywhere else with a large Middle Eastern population, you will feel like you're eating at your favorite place! Trust me.", "Soak rice in a bowl of water for 10 minutes; drain and rinse until the water runs clear.", "Heat 1/4 cup butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil together in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir orzo until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add drained rice and increase heat to medium-high. Cook and stir orzo-rice mixture until rice is coated in butter-oil mixture and starts to turn translucent, about 5 minutes.", "Pour water over rice mixture and season with salt; stir and bring to a boil. Cover skillet, reduce heat to low, and simmer until rice is fluffy and tender yet firm, about 20 minutes.", "Heat remaining olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir almonds until toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add remaining butter and stir in tahini until almonds are evenly coated. Mix almond mixture into rice mixture.", "Squeeze a little lemon over the top of the rice at the end for some added tartness.", "Use other roasted nuts like pistachios or cashews or even add some golden raisins for variety.", "Some restaurants also use little pieces of vermicelli or angel hair pasta instead of orzo so you can substitute those, if desired."], "nutrition facts": "203 calories; protein 2.8g; carbohydrates 18g; fat 13.4g; cholesterol 20.3mg; sodium 641.1mg"}
