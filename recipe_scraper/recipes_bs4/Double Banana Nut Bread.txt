This recipe works well for low and high altitudes without making any adjustments.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Fold in walnuts. Pour batter into the two prepared loaf pans.", "Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes.", "Be sure not to over-beat the batter. Toothpick inserted in center of bread should come out somewhat moist. If toothpick comes out clean, you have overcooked the bread.
