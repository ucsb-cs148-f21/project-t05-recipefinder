I'm not much of a sugar cookie person, but these taste wonderful and hold up to shaping very well. They don't get dry and hard like so many other recipes.

Store in a tightly sealed container with waxed paper between layers at room temperature for up to 2 weeks or freeze for up to 3 months.", "Beat egg yolks and almond paste together in a bowl using a mixer on medium speed until crumbly, about 2 minutes. Add butter, sugar, and salt to almond paste mixture and beat until creamy, about 3 minutes; reduce speed to low and gradually beat in flour just until blended.", "Divide dough into 4 pieces and flatten each into a disk on a lightly floured surface. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and chill for 2 hours.", "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).", "Place 1 dough piece on a lightly floured surface and roll into 1/4-inch thickness using a floured rolling pin.
