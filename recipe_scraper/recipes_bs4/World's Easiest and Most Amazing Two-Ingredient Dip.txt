I strongly encourage using Kikkoman\u00ae soy sauce, as other brands I have tried tasted very different and not nearly as good.", "Mix sour cream and soy sauce together in a bowl until evenly combined.", "You can add more or less soy sauce to taste - it's hard to mess up."], "nutrition facts": "127 calories; protein 2.3g; carbohydrates 3.1g; fat 12.1g; cholesterol 25.3mg; sodium 481.4mg"}
