{"name": "Chef John's Chicken Under a Brick", "prep": "10 mins", "cook": "40 mins", "additional": "20 mins", "total": "70 mins", "servings": "6", "yield": "1 whole chicken", "ingredients": ["1 (3 1/2) pound whole chicken, wings removed", "salt and ground black pepper to taste", "1 pinch herbes de Provence, or to taste", "1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed", "2 heavy clay bricks, wrapped tightly in aluminum foil"], "steps": ["You should use a big cast iron pan for this, but it will also work in a high-quality, heavy-duty stainless steel pan, or other oven-proof skillet. The key is to heat it very well before the chicken goes in. Other than that, there's really no way to screw it up, unless you under or overcook it, which won't happen, since you're going to check it with the thermometer.", "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).", "Use kitchen shears to cut down both sides of the backbone. Remove backbone and discard. Cut through breastbone from the inside until chicken folds out like a book and lays flat.", "Season chicken all over with salt and black pepper, and sprinkle herbes de Provence on the inside. Let chicken sit for 20 to 30 minutes at room temperature; pat dry with paper towels. Brush skin-side of chicken with oil and season again with salt and black pepper.", "Heat an oven-proof cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot, about 5 minutes. Place chicken, skin-side down, in hot skillet and place bricks evenly on top to weigh down chicken.", "Roast chicken in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove bricks, turn chicken over, and continue roasting until juices run clear and meat is no longer pink at the bone, 5 to 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).", "Preheat the oven's broiler and broil the chicken until skin is crispy and golden, 1 to 3 minutes."], "nutrition facts": "303 calories; protein 43.1g; fat 13.3g; cholesterol 132.5mg; sodium 153.8mg"}
