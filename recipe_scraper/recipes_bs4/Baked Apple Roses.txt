I really hope you give these gorgeous looking, and very delicious apple roses a try soon. Enjoy!", "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter 2 small ramekins (6 to 8 ounce) and dust with white sugar.", "Place apple slices on a plate, overlapping slightly if necessary. Microwave on High about 45 seconds just until slices have softened a bit. Cover plate with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel.", "Mix together sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.", "Roll puff pastry sheet to less than 1/8-inch thickness. Using a pizza cutter, cut two 3-inch by 12-inch rectangles. Reserve remaining pieces for another use.", "Spread melted butter over dough; top with a generous amount of cinnamon-sugar. Place apple slices along 1 long edge of dough, about 1/4 inch beyond edge of dough, overlapping slices slightly. Fold bottom half of dough over the apple slices to form a long \"folder\" of dough with rounded edges of apple slices exposed.", "Beat egg and water together in a bowl. Paint surface of dough with egg wash. Sprinkle with more cinnamon-sugar, to taste.", "Starting from one end, roll dough not too tightly to form a rose-shaped pastry. Seal roll with end of dough strip.", "Transfer roses to prepared ramekins. Sprinkle with a little more cinnamon-sugar. Place ramekins directly on middle rack of preheated oven.", "Bake until well browned, about 45 minutes. Remove ramekins with tongs and place on baking sheet to cool 5 to 10 minutes. Remove apple roses from ramekins and finish cooling on rack. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.", "If you don't have a microwave, just saut\u00e9 your apple slices in a little bit of butter over medium heat for about half a minute per side, or until flexible but not soft.", "If you use a metal muffin pan instead of a ramekin, I would reduce the heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), and cook about 45 minutes, or until the pastry is well browned.", "Nutrition data for this recipe includes the full amount of the puff pastry, not just what is needed for this recipe."], "nutrition facts": "1058 calories; protein 12.1g; carbohydrates 96.3g; fat 71.3g; cholesterol 142.8mg; sodium 495.5mg"}
