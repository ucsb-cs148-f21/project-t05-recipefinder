Gnudi are ricotta-based gnocchi, and are usually made with spinach. However, I forgot to buy spinach and thought I'd use up some of my bumper crop of basil. These are delicate, delicious, and surprisingly easy. The recipe is very forgiving. The basil is intense and wonderful with these little cheese dumplings. I used a mix of both Genovese and Amethyst basil and the results were purple and green! Serve with butter, pesto, or chopped fresh tomatoes, capers and olives as either a main course or a side dish", "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add basil and cook uncovered until just wilted, about 1 minute. Immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain. Squeeze very dry and finely chop.", "Mix ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup flour, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, egg yolks, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Add basil, white pepper, and salt; mix until gnudi mixture is well-combined.", "Dust your hands with remaining 1/4 cup flour and form gnudi mixture into small balls.", "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add lemon juice. Boil gnudi in batches until they float to the top of the water, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain.", "The boiling water may require skimming and you may need to add additional water.", "Basil may brown as it boils so don't be surprised if the water turns slightly brown. The gnudi do not turn brown, just the water."], "nutrition facts": "185 calories; protein 11.3g; carbohydrates 22.5g; fat 6.1g; cholesterol 111.2mg; sodium 1042mg"}
