Place chicken in hot oil and sprinkle with poultry seasoning and black pepper. Cook and stir chicken in hot oil until no longer pink, 5 to 8 minutes.", "Pour water into skillet and bring to a simmer. Stir angel hair pasta, peas, and mushrooms into skillet; cook until pasta is tender, 4 to 5 minutes.", "Stir wine and garlic powder into pasta mixture. Add spinach and stir until spinach wilts, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle individual servings with Parmesan cheese.", "Play with the veggies and seasonings.
