It's a unique dish packed with flavor.", "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).", "Toss sliced shallot with olive oil in a heavy pot or dutch oven until well coated.", "Arrange sausages atop shallot mixture.", "Bake in the preheated oven until the sausage is no longer pink in the center, turning sausages occasionally to brown evenly, 25 to 30 minutes.

Remove cheese sauce from heat, stirring occasionally to keep sauce smooth.", "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the gnocchi at a boil until it floats to the top, about 3 minutes; drain.", "Serve sausage and gnocchi topped with cheese sauce and sprinkle with reserved cheese and basil.", "Prepacked gnocchi generally takes anywhere from 3-4 minutes - cook it until it floats. I normally drop the gnocchi into the water as I start making the sauce. On the cheese blend, feel free to experiment with different ratios - Soft cheeses like Mozzarella, Provolone, and Fontina melt great and each add their own unique flavor. Hard cheeses like Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago, add layers of flavor."], "nutrition facts": "903 calories; protein 38.9g; carbohydrates 30.2g; fat 69.8g; cholesterol 161.7mg; sodium 1968.2mg"}
