I love the way onions and celery smell when they're cooked with rosemary. It reminds me of the beginning of autumn. When it's done, it looks like a lot, but you have to realize it's mostly all veggies! The measurements are all approximate. I don't measure out things when I cook, I just eyeball them, so feel free to adjust ingredients to your liking. Serve with your favorite toast and a strong cup of coffee.
