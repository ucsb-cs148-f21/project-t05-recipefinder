The seeds had so much value they were used as a form of currency. Originally prepared only as a drink, chocolate was served bitter and spicy. Often this gift from the gods was reserved for royalty and religious leadership. It was believed to give strength and so was added to a soldier's rations. Later it was seen as an aphrodisiac which made it much more popular. I have used their spirit as inspiration for this sweet and spicy rice pudding.", "Combine water, rice, and cinnamon in a large pot; bring to a boil.
