It's filling, healthy, and delicious! If you generally make oatmeal with milk instead of water, don't! The acid in the cranberries will make the milk separate. I tried it. It will still taste okay, but it won't look very pretty.", "Combine water, apple, and cranberries together in a bowl; bring to a boil. Cook mixture until cranberries burst and apple is tender, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and stir oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt into apple mixture. Cook, stirring continuously, until water is absorbed and oatmeal thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Top oatmeal with walnuts."], "nutrition facts": "500 calories; protein 10.1g; carbohydrates 71.5g; fat 22g; sodium 19.1mg"}
