{"name": "Chef John's Chocolate Energy Bars", "prep": "15 mins", "additional": "2 hrs 45 mins", "total": "2 hrs 60 mins", "servings": "12", "yield": "12 bars", "ingredients": ["2 cups pitted Medjool dates, roughly chopped", "2 cups raw cashews", "1 cup raw or roasted unsalted almonds", "\u00be cup high-quality unsweetened cocoa powder (such as Guittard\u00ae Cocoa Rouge)", "2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted", "\u00bd cup unsweetened shredded coconut", "2 teaspoons vanilla extract", "1 tablespoon cold espresso, or more as needed (or water)", "\u00bd teaspoon kosher salt", "\u00bd pinch cayenne pepper"], "steps": ["If you compare these chocolate energy bars to similar fruit/nut bars sold at the store, I think they taste better, are nutritionally superior, and probably cheaper to make at home. The only problem is they look so good it takes your brain a millisecond to process that they're not going to taste like the fudge brownies they resemble.", "Place cashews, almonds, coconut, dates, cocoa, coconut oil, vanilla, cold coffee, cayenne and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse on and off to start. Process about 1 minute; check to ensure mixture is sticky and moist enough to stick together. Add more coffee if needed. Continue to process until mixture becomes a chunky mass.", "Line a baking pan with plastic wrap. Scoop mixture into pan. Press down with a spatula until mixture is even. Place a layer of plastic wrap on the surface and smooth again with your hands.", "Refrigerate until cold and firm, 2 or 3 hours.", "Remove from the pan and unwrap. Cut into bars of your preferred size. Store in a zip top back in the refrigerator.", "Try your hardest to find Medjool dates, but if you can't, any dried date should work, as long as it's soft and sticky enough. If the ones you're using seem too hard and dry, simply soak them in water until they soften up a bit."], "nutrition facts": "343 calories; protein 8.1g; carbohydrates 36g; fat 22.2g; sodium 229.6mg"}
