I generally use the contents of my vegetable drawer here so I kind of throw in whatever I have at the time, so you can use your own judgment. They taste really nice when eaten with sour cream or low-fat mayo or even on their own - though my husband prefers ketchup. I generally use this recipe as a guideline, so have fun with it!", "Soak bread in water in a large shallow dish until softened completely; remove from dish and squeeze as much water from bread as possible.", "Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, spinach, and garlic in the hot oil until the onion softens, about 5 minutes.", "Mix the onion mixture with softened bread, tuna, mushrooms, zucchini, celery, eggs, dill, salt, pepper, basil, and oregano in a large bowl until combined. Form the mixture into about 24 thin, palm-size patties.", "Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook the patties in the skillet until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side.", "If you have pre-sliced bread from the store, that can be used as well; you just have to use more of it, so probably about 5 or 6 slices."], "nutrition facts": "43 calories; protein 3.8g; carbohydrates 3g; fat 1.8g; cholesterol 18.6mg; sodium 133mg"}
