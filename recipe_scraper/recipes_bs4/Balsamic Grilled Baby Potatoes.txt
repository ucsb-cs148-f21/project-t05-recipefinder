{"name": "Balsamic Grilled Baby Potatoes", "prep": "10 mins", "cook": "25 mins", "total": "35 mins", "servings": "6", "yield": "6 servings", "ingredients": ["2 pounds baby (1 to 2-inch long) potatoes, halved lengthwise", "2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar", "1 tablespoon olive oil", "2 tablespoons onion powder", "salt and ground black pepper to taste", "2 tablespoons butter, cut into small chunks"], "steps": ["If you've got the grill going anyway, this is a quick and easy side dish that is a hit in our household.", "Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.", "Place a 24-inch long piece of aluminum foil on a flat work surface. Spread potatoes onto the middle of the foil. Drizzle vinegar and olive oil over the potatoes; season with onion powder, salt, and pepper. Dot the top of the potatoes with small chunks of butter.", "Bring opposing sides of the foil up and around the potatoes. Fold the two edges together at the top to create a seam on the top of the packet. Fold the remaining two edges to seal the packet.", "Cook potatoes in the packet on the preheated grill with the seam-side facing up for about 10 minutes, turn and cook another 10 minutes. Turn the packet once again and continue cooking until a fork stuck through the foil and into the potatoes meet no resistance from the contents, about 5 minutes more.", "You can use regular potatoes cut into 1 to 2-inch cubes in place of the baby-size potatoes.", "Only fork-test near the end of cooking as this will release steam and juices.", "Double up the foil if you are using a bargain brand. If you don't have a big grill you can keep the potatoes wrapped and on a plate while you grill your protein - they will stay warm. \r\n\r\nBe sure to open the packet carefully as the contents will steam and are very hot. \r\n\r\nVegetarians can omit the butter and increase the oil with similar results.", "Be sure to open the packet carefully as the contents will steam and are very hot.", "Vegetarians can omit the butter and increase the oil with similar results.", "If you don't have a big grill you can keep the potatoes wrapped and on a plate while you grill your protein; they will stay warm."], "nutrition facts": "181 calories; protein 3.3g; carbohydrates 29g; fat 6.3g; cholesterol 10.2mg; sodium 38.8mg"}
