If you want to spend more time on it, you can make your own sauce and breadcrumbs, but I'm often looking for a quick potluck meal, and this is an easy, fast recipe that always gets great reviews.", "Place tofu onto a plate and place another plate on top. Set a 3 to 5 pound weight on top; press tofu until water is extracted and tofu is firmer, about 15 minutes. Drain and discard the accumulated liquid. Slice tofu into 1-inch wide by 4-inch long pieces.", "Whisk egg in a small bowl. Pour breadcrumbs into separate shallow bowl. Dip tofu pieces into beaten egg and press into bread crumbs. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded tofu pieces onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.", "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry tofu in a single layer, browning completely on each side before turning, about 3 minutes per side. Place fried tofu on serving platter.", "Combine hot pepper sauce and butter in a bowl; pour over fried tofu. Serve with blue cheese dressing and celery pieces.", "If you prefer thicker breading, dip the tofu in flour, then in egg, and then in the breadcrumbs.", "I prefer olive oil in the recipe, but vegetable oil can be substituted, if desired.", "Tofu can be deep-fried instead of sauteed, if desired."], "nutrition facts": "517 calories; protein 14.1g; carbohydrates 25.4g; fat 41.3g; cholesterol 82.2mg; sodium 2874mg"}
