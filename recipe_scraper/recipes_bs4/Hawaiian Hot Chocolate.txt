Surprisingly, it does get chilly in Hawaii, especially at night and in cold, rainy regions. This is a different take on the usual cold and frozen Hawaiian libations.", "Whisk half-and-half, milk, sugar, and cocoa powder in a saucepan over medium-high heat until cocoa and sugar dissolve. Remove from heat when mixture begins to steam, 5 to 10 minutes.", "Whisk vanilla extract, coconut extract, and salt into cocoa mixture. Pour into glasses and top each with whipped cream and toasted coconut.", "Can substitute coconut emulsion for coconut extract. Coconut emulsion pairs well with cocoa better than coconut extracts that I have tried. Likely due to less alcohol in the emulsion. The emulsion I use has a strong flavor, and recipes may need to be adjusted based on flavor and your preference.", "Add 1 to 2 tablespoons coconut rum to each mug before serving to make an adult version of this hot chocolate."], "nutrition facts": "445 calories; protein 9.9g; carbohydrates 45.3g; fat 26.5g; cholesterol 77.7mg; sodium 365mg"}
