If I've made it at home I've probably just bought a bottle of teriyaki sauce and brushed it on some chicken. This is an authentic version. I'm very glad I did it. The term teriyaki comes from of two Japanese words 'teri' and 'yaki'. Teri refers to the shine or luster of the glazed sauce, and yaki means to broil or grill the meat.", "Whisk soy sauce, sake, mirin, brown sugar, white parts of green onions, and ginger together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer and cook until sugar dissolves and marinade flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Pour marinade into a bowl and cool to room temperature.", "Pour 1/2 the marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken thighs, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, 30 minutes to 1 hour.", "Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with vegetable oil.", "Arrange chicken thighs on prepared baking sheet. Discard excess marinade.", "Broil chicken in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Flip thighs and broil for 5 minutes more. Flip thighs again and brush each thigh with reserved marinade. Continue to broil, brushing with reserved marinade every 1 to 2 minutes, until cooked through, about 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with dark green parts of green onions.", "The nutrition data for this recipe includes the full amount of the marinade ingredients.
