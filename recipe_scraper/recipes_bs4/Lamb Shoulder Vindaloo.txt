{"name": "Lamb Shoulder Vindaloo", "prep": "5 mins", "cook": "1 hr 15 mins", "total": "1 hr 20 mins", "servings": "4", "yield": "4 servings", "ingredients": ["1 tablespoon olive oil", "\u215b teaspoon brown mustard seeds", "\u00bc teaspoon whole black peppercorns", "1 pinch whole fenugreek seeds", "1\u2009\u00bc pounds lamb shoulder chops", "1 (3 ounce) package curry sauce (such as Sukhi's\u00ae)", "2 leaves basil, torn"], "steps": ["This is a recipe that I cobbled together from three others, two from Madhur Jaffrey's At Home with Madhur Jaffrey. Enjoy with Basmati rice, naan, or other Indian side dish.", "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour olive oil into hot pan and heat until shimmering. Cook mustard seeds in hot oil until they begin to pop, about 1 minute; immediately add peppercorns and fenugreek seeds.", "Gently lay the lamb chops in a single layer into the skillet; add curry sauce and basil and stir. Bring the sauce to a boil, place a tight-fitting lid on the skillet, reduce heat to low, and cook until the lamb is tender, 60 to 70 minutes.", "Remove lid from skillet. Continue to cook and stir until most of the liquid has been reduced and the meat has a brownish look on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes more.", "You can make this recipe with other meats, but the simmering time will need to be adjusted. For example, if using chicken thighs, you will only want to simmer for 20 minutes.", "When substituting the lamb, it may be all meat or a combination of meat and vegetables, but it should total 1 1/4 pounds in weight.", "You could also make this a vegetarian dish, again adjusting the simmering time."], "nutrition facts": "485 calories; protein 23.7g; carbohydrates 0.9g; fat 42.2g; cholesterol 105mg; sodium 152.2mg"}
