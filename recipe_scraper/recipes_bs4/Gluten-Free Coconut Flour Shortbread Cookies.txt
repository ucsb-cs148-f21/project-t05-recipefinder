Without the additional coconut flavor, they have the faint aroma and taste of coconut thanks to coconut flour. With the flavor, you'll have a cookie with robust coconut taste, perfect for dunking into a pot of chocolate fondue or glass of milk.", "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment.", "Mix all the ingredients, by hand or mixer, until a well-blended, cohesive dough forms; this will take about 2 minutes at medium-low speed in a stand mixer.", "Drop the cookie dough by teaspoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet (a teaspoon cookie scoop works well here), leaving 1 inch between them; these cookies won't spread much when they bake.", "Use a fork to flatten each cookie to about 1/4 inch thick, making a cross-hatch design.", "Bake the cookies for 8 to 12 minutes, until just browned on the bottom. Allow the cookies to cool completely on the baking sheet."], "nutrition facts": "42 calories; protein 0.6g; carbohydrates 4.5g; fat 2.6g; cholesterol 14mg; sodium 31.3mg"}
