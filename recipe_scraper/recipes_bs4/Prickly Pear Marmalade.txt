I've never tried any commercial prickly pear jam or jelly, so I don't know if this is how it's supposed to taste, but my toddler does keep asking for more, so it's a win for our family. Store any extra jam in the refrigerator.", "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add six 4-ounce jars; simmer to sterilize. Wash lids and rings in warm soapy water.", "Slice ends off each prickly pear. Make 1 long vertical slit down each one. Use the slit to hold the skin and peel off. Discard peel. Cut flesh into quarters and transfer to a saucepan; mash with a potato masher.", "Simmer prickly pear flesh over medium-low heat until soft, 30 to 45 minutes. Press cooked flesh through the fine screen on a food mill set over a bowl.", "Measure 1 1/4 cup prickly pear pulp into the saucepan. Add sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and butter; bring to a boil. Stir in pectin until dissolved, about 1 minute.", "Pour prickly pear mixture into hot jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top.
