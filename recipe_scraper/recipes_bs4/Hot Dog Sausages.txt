{"name": "Hot Dog Sausages", "prep": "15 mins", "cook": "10 mins", "additional": "2 hrs", "total": "2 hrs 25 mins", "servings": "4", "yield": "4 hot dog sausages", "ingredients": ["1\u2009\u00bc pounds lean ground beef", "\u00bc pound ground pork", "4 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 tablespoon paprika", "2 teaspoons ground black pepper", "1 teaspoon granulated onion powder", "1 teaspoon granulated garlic", "\u00bd teaspoon smoked paprika", "\u2153 cup ice water", "4 hot dog buns, split and toasted"], "steps": ["I wondered what would happen if I did a skewer-less kebab using the same ingredients that would typically go into a hotdog. This meaty mash-up came about thanks to some lamb kebab experiments. The firm texture of the kebab reminded me of a hot dog's 'snap.' The taste is actually closer to a bratwurst.", "Place ground beef, ground pork, salt, paprika, black pepper, granulated onion, granulated garlic, smoked paprika, and ice water in a bowl. Mix together with fingers until well blended and mixture is dense and solid, about 4 minutes. It's okay to overmix. Wrap dough in plastic; refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.", "Place a sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface. Have a bowl of ice water nearby to keep your hands wet and cold. Place 1/4 of the mixture on the plastic wrap. Roughly shape meat into a thick roll and wrap with the plastic. Shape into a thinner roll about as long as a hot dog bun. You can unroll the plastic and \"fine tune\" the sausage shape after wetting your hands in ice water. Rewrap in plastic and place on a dish; repeat for the remaining sausages. Refrigerate until ready to cook.", "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.", "Carefully place sausages on grill and let them cook undisturbed for about 2 minutes to seal the bottom edge. Gently turn completely over to brown the opposite side; cook until brown, about 2 minutes. Brown all surfaces, turning carefully to avoid breaking the sausages, about 5 minutes more. Remove sausages from grill and serve on toasted hot dog buns."], "nutrition facts": "461 calories; protein 36.6g; carbohydrates 24g; fat 23.5g; cholesterol 111.2mg; sodium 2227.4mg"}
