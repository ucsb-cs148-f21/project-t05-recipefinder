{"name": "Real Canadian Poutine", "prep": "10 mins", "cook": "25 mins", "total": "35 mins", "servings": "4", "yield": "4 servings", "ingredients": ["1 (14 ounce) package frozen French fries", "2 tablespoons butter", "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour", "1\u2009\u00bd cups beef broth", "salt and ground black pepper to taste", "1\u2009\u00bd cups cheese curds"], "steps": ["Poutine originated from rural Qu\u00e9bec province in the 1950s. I would say poutine is not second to any other food in Canada. I order poutine when I go to diners, but I also buy fresh cheese curd to make my own at home. Homemade gravy is really easy and quick to make. The only rule I don't follow for authentic poutine is that I don't fry my French fries; I bake them in the oven. Be careful. This is very addictive!", "Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.", "Spread fries in a single layer over prepared baking sheet.", "Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, about 15 minutes.", "Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in flour vigorously. When mixture bubbles, reduce heat to low; cook and stir until the mixture thins, about 2 minutes. Whisk in beef broth. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until gravy has thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.", "Place fries on a serving plate or in individual bowls. Distribute the cheese curds over the fries; pour hot gravy over the fries and curds. Serve immediately.", "You may use mozzarella cheese as substitute, but it is never the same. I hope you can find cheese curds in your local markets."], "nutrition facts": "427 calories; protein 16.5g; carbohydrates 29.5g; fat 27.2g; cholesterol 67.2mg; sodium 710.7mg"}
