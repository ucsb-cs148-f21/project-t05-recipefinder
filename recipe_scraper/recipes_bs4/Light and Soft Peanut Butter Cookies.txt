They were always too greasy-feeling or too hard and never were soft a few days later. After a lot of trial and error batches, now I get rave reviews from these cookies. They are very rich and soft for those who do not like the typical crunchy style of peanut butter cookies. They do take a bit of time to prepare and cook but very much worth the wait. I used reduced-fat peanut butter in both crunchy and creamy to make for a rich-tasting cookie with more peanut flavor and a less greasy feeling on your hand.", "Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
