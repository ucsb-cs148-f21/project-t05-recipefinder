I also substituted the oil with applesauce! They came out great and all 3 of my kids loved them! The recipe made 20 pancakes; you can halve it if you do not need that many. I freeze the extras for another day!", "Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk almond milk, applesauce, eggs, and almond extract together in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to almond milk mixture and stir until batter is just moistened. Stir granola and almonds into batter.", "Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.", "You can add vanilla instead of almond and pretty much do whatever sounds good! The granola I used had raisins. The pancakes really do not need any syrup; they are good plain!", "You can substitute honey for the sugar, whole wheat pastry flour for the all-purpose flour, and vanilla almond milk or 1% cow's milk for the almond milk."], "nutrition facts": "281 calories; protein 8.6g; carbohydrates 41g; fat 8.9g; cholesterol 46.5mg; sodium 596.7mg"}
