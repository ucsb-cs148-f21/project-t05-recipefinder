This is a great change up to the ordinary chips and salsa. It goes great with chips or as a quesadilla topping. It's different from your typical Mexican fare, but it is fantastic. This is a pretty forgiving recipe and you can adjust ingredients to your liking. You can add more cilantro, onion or jalapeno depending on your tastes. You can eat this right away but it is best after you have given the flavors an hour or two to blend. For those that don't like it too hot, La Costena\u00ae brand makes a great pickled jalapeno that has lots of flavor and not too much heat.", "Combine cabbage, tomatoes, red onion, jalapeno slices, 2 tablespoons juice from jalapenos, cilantro, lime juice, vinegar, chili powder, black pepper, salt, and cayenne pepper in a bowl; refrigerate for flavors to blend, 1 to 2 hours."], "nutrition facts": "42 calories; protein 1.9g; carbohydrates 9.8g; fat 0.2g; sodium 139.3mg"}
