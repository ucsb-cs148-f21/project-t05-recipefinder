Low in cholesterol and sodium, a good source of dietary fiber, high in Vitamin C, Vitamin K and folate, and they are moderately anti-inflammatory. I like to serve the dressing on the side to keep portion sizes in check. With this salad, since the avocados are already slightly marinated in lime juice, you really don't need much more than a couple tablespoons of the vinaigrette to add the zing necessary to bring this salad alive. Enjoy with my low calorie-biscuits and you have a very satisfying and waist-trimming meal!", "Toss avocado slices with 1/2 of the lime juice in a bowl.", "Mash 3 avocado slices with a fork in a bowl.
