We make them every Christmas and there are never enough. The dough is easy to work with and they are easy to make!", "Cut butter into flour in a bowl using 2 knives or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.", "Combine walnuts, sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 baking sheets.", "Cut dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 1/8-inch thick circle on a lightly floured surface.

Transfer cookies carefully to the baking sheets.", "Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 20 to 25 minutes.
