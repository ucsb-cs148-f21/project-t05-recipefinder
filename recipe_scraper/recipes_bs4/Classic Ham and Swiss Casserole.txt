{"name": "Classic Ham and Swiss Casserole", "prep": "15 mins", "cook": "30 mins", "additional": "2 hrs 5 mins", "total": "2 hrs 50 mins", "servings": "8", "yield": "8 servings", "ingredients": ["1 (1 pound) loaf sourdough bread, cut into cubes", "1 (8 ounce) bottle honey mustard", "2 cups shredded Swiss cheese, divided", "2 cups diced ham, divided", "1 (6 ounce) jar dill pickle relish, drained"], "steps": ["This my take on the classic 'reuben casserole,' which I love. Try it and add your own variation, depending on your tastes. Different meats, cheeses, breads, or dressings would make for a variety of tastes.", "Spread the bread cubes into a shallow pan and let the bread sit until the cut surfaces are somewhat dried with the insides remaining soft, 2 to 3 hours.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.", "Put bread cubes into a large bowl. Pour honey mustard over the bread and mix to coat. Layer about half the bread cubes into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle 2/3 cup Swiss cheese over the bread cubes; top with 1 cup ham. Spread relish in a layer over everything. Layer remaining ham, 2/3 cup Swiss cheese, and remaining bread cubes, respectively, atop the relish layer. Finish by topping with the remaining Swiss cheese. Cover entire dish with aluminum foil.", "Bake in preheated oven until hot in the center, about 30 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before cutting to serve.", "I cut my bread frozen, then place in a shallow pan in the oven to thaw and dry out the cubes. The cube should be dry on the outside, soft on the inside, but not crouton-dry. This allows the dressing to soak into the cube and hold it in during baking."], "nutrition facts": "374 calories; protein 19.8g; carbohydrates 46.7g; fat 13.4g; cholesterol 42.3mg; sodium 1195.3mg"}
