Made with any organic nut butter of choice. Great with almond butter, peanut butter, you name it! We think better than the old fashioned PB cookie even. I find the dark chocolate chips at our local Co-Op health food stores. They even have some made with stevia if you like to be even lower in the sugars. This is a fast easy recipe sure to please!
