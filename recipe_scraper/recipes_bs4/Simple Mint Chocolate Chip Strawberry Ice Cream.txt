This recipe creates a fresh and sweet treat with minimal sugar allowing you to indulge in fruit and chocolate, the best of both worlds! Store the remaining ice cream in a container in your freezer for later enjoyment!", "Mix heavy cream, whole milk, sugar, and peppermint extract in a bowl. Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze until slightly thickened, 25 to 30 minutes (time varies according to ice cream maker specifications). Stir chocolate and strawberries into ice cream mixture; allow to mix until thickened, 3 to 5 more minutes.", "You can skip the prep time by simply adding your ingredients to the ice cream maker as it's mixing. Begin with the milk, next add the heavy whipping cream, next the sugar, and finally add in the extract and let the machine mix it up for you. This will save you some time in the kitchen and get your ice cream started in an instant. You can also experiment with the amount of mint extract that you put in the ice cream. If you prefer a mintier ice cream, add 1 teaspoon of mint extract. And finally, this recipe makes a great mint chocolate chip ice cream by omitting the strawberries."], "nutrition facts": "313 calories; protein 2.7g; carbohydrates 20.4g; fat 25.3g; cholesterol 84.9mg; sodium 35.3mg"}
