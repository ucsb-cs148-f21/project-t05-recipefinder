It's that contrast between the rich, fluffy cream and the syrupy, tangy fruit that makes this so much greater than the sum of its parts.\u00a0Fresh berries are a classic, but this would work with peeled, diced, ripe peaches.", "Place raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries in a bowl. Add lemon zest, lemon juice, and 1/4 cup sugar. Stir until sugar is mixed with fruit and juices begin to form. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.", "Place heavy cream and creme fraiche in a cold bowl. Add 1 tablespoon sugar and vanilla extract. Whisk until mixture has soft peaks and sharp lines, 5 to 8 minutes.", "Place some cookie crumbs in the bottom of each serving dish. Spoon in some of the fruit and a layer of whipped cream. Repeat layers, ending with a sprinkle of cookie crumbs.", "You can substitute plain yogurt or sour cream for the cr\u00e8me fraiche but, if you do, wait until the whipping cream is almost completely whipped before adding."], "nutrition facts": "646 calories; protein 6.3g; carbohydrates 64.8g; fat 41.7g; cholesterol 113.2mg; sodium 286.5mg"}
