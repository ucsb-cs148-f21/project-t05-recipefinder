Grease a 1-quart casserole dish.", "Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add squash and onion, cover, and steam until squash is tender and easily mashed with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes.", "Whisk egg and sour cream together in the prepared casserole dish; add squash, onions, 2/3 the crackers, and 2/3 the Cheddar cheese.

However, under normal conditions, the finished casserole should feed six adults. We also like to steam the squash and onions and then freeze them to use when summer is over. This cuts down on prep time by about 45-55 minutes since all you have to do is crush the crackers and mix the ingredients once the squash is thawed out."], "nutrition facts": "369 calories; protein 15.3g; carbohydrates 24.9g; fat 24g; cholesterol 86.3mg; sodium 438.8mg"}
