You need to get your hands greasy on this one, but it's well worth it! It's succulent and savory - just what a prime rib should be! Pan juices from the roast can be added to the Au Jus at the last minute if need be.", "Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Place a rack on a shallow roasting pan.", "Coat entire roast with 1 cup softened butter. Set roast fat-side up on the rack.", "Mix salt, tarragon, allspice, and black pepper together in a bowl. Rub salt mixture all over roast.", "Bake roast in the preheated oven until outside is crisp and browned, about 50 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking roast until the internal temperature reaches 150 degrees F (65 degrees C), 35 to 40 minutes.", "Remove roast from oven. Spoon pan juices into a small bowl; set aside.
