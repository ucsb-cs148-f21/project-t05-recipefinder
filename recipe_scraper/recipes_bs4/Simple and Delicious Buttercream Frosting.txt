{"name": "Simple and Delicious Buttercream Frosting", "prep": "15 mins", "total": "15 mins", "servings": "12", "yield": "12 servings", "ingredients": ["5 tablespoons salted butter", "5 tablespoons shortening", "\u00be teaspoon vanilla extract", "2 cups confectioners' sugar", "2 tablespoons milk"], "steps": ["I decided on a whim yesterday that I wanted to make cupcakes for Canada Day. I didn't have time to buy frosting before getting ready for the fireworks show, so I ended up making my own with ingredients I already had. I was shocked at how quick and easy this was! This basic vanilla recipe makes enough to cover a dozen cupcakes, but feel free to double it (for cakes), triple it, add food coloring or different flavor extracts. If you find this too sweet, you can add a dash of salt to the milk or the vanilla. Personally I like it sweet, and I used salted butter, so I didn't find it necessary.", "Beat butter and shortening together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Beat the vanilla extract into the butter mixture. Add sugar, one cup at a time, beating on medium speed until fully incorporated. Add milk, one tablespoon at a time, beating on high until fully incorporated and you have frosting."], "nutrition facts": "173 calories; protein 0.1g; carbohydrates 21g; fat 10.2g; cholesterol 12.9mg; sodium 35.4mg"}
