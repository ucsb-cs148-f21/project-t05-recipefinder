These are perfect for St. Patrick's Day.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).", "Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.", "Bring Irish stout beer and 1 cup butter to a boil in a saucepan and set aside until butter has melted, stirring occasionally.

I actually added a lot of Baileys to my frosting because the butter would never get fluffy enough but it turned out fine."], "nutrition facts": "387 calories; protein 3.3g; carbohydrates 48.8g; fat 20.3g; cholesterol 60.8mg; sodium 253.3mg"}
