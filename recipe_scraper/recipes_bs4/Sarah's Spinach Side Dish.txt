It goes great with a homestyle meal or when making something lite and healthy. Regular butter or whole milk can be substituted. I use whipped butter and low-fat milk to reduce saturated fat. Fresh spinach may be used, although I recommend frozen, but will need to be boiled until tender, finely chopped, and dried very well. Double the sauce ingredients to make a slightly creamy texture.
