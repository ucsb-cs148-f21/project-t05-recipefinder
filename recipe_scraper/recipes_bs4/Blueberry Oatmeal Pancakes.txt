After trying dozens of other people's recipes, I took ideas from all of them to create this. It's probably the most delicious thing I've ever had! By substituting out the eggs, it's easy to turn this into a vegan meal as well. Try a bite before topping with syrup, it's decadently yummy as-is! I make 'silver dollar' pancakes to take as snacks to potlucks.", "Process oats in a blender or food processor until the consistency of flour. Combine ground oats, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.", "Whisk eggs, honey, almond milk, 1 tablespoon coconut oil, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Stir oat mixture into egg mixture until batter is well mixed; fold in blueberries.", "Heat 1 teaspoon coconut oil on a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.", "You don't have to make sure all the grains are ground when processing into a flour. Leaving some adds some nice texture.", "My son mixes the liquid ingredients in a blender, and then blends again after adding the blueberries, because he doesn't like how lumpy the berries make the pancakes. I love biting into a nice juicy berry, but they're delicious either way.", "Agave nectar or maple syrup can be used in place of the honey if desired.", "Any type of milk can be used in place of the almond milk.", "Two cups steel-cut oats or 1 1/2 cups oat flour can be substituted for the rolled oats."], "nutrition facts": "345 calories; protein 8.9g; carbohydrates 57.4g; fat 10.1g; cholesterol 93mg; sodium 400.7mg"}
