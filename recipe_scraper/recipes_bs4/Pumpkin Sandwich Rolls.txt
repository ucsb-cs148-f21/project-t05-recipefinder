Mix the dough in the morning and then refrigerate it until a couple hours before you want to serve the rolls. The technique for stenciling on a design using rye flour will work for any holiday.

Attach the dough hook to the stand mixture and mix on low speed with the dough hook for 5 minutes, using a bowl scraper or stiff spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl once or twice. Increase speed to medium-low. Add butter one piece at a time, mixing until each piece is completely incorporated before adding the next.", "Transfer the dough to a greased bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature until dough has doubled, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.", "While the dough rises, draw designs with permanent marker onto a flexible plastic lid.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until approximately 2 hours before you wish to serve the rolls.", "Remove dough from the refrigerator and scrape from bowl onto a flour-dusted work surface.

Put dough balls in freezer until firm, then transfer them into a resealable freezer bag. They will keep frozen for up to three months.", "To bake frozen rolls: arrange rolls on parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover rolls with greased plastic wrap and thaw in the refrigerator overnight.
