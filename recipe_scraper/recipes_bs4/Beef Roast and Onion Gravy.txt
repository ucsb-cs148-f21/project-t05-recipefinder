{"name": "Beef Roast and Onion Gravy", "prep": "15 mins", "additional": "1 hr 55 mins", "total": "1 hr 70 mins", "servings": "12", "yield": "12 servings", "ingredients": ["1 (3 pound) boneless beef eye of round roast", "\u00bd teaspoon ground black pepper", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil", "1 small onion, finely chopped", "3 cloves garlic, minced", "1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley", "1 (26 ounce) carton Swanson\u00ae Beef Stock or Swanson\u00ae Unsalted Beef Stock", "\u00bc cup all-purpose flour"], "steps": ["Flavorful beef stock serves double-duty in this tasty recipe as it is used as a basting sauce for the roast and to make the savory onion-studded pan gravy.", "Heat the oven to 325 degrees F. Place the beef, fat-side up, onto a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Season the beef with half the black pepper.", "Roast for 1 1/2 hours for medium-rare or until desired doneness. Remove the beef from the pan. Let the beef stand for 15 minutes before slicing.", "Add the oil to the roasting pan and heat over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, parsley and remaining black pepper to the pan. Cook and stir until the onion is tender-crisp, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.", "Stir the stock and flour in a large bowl until smooth. Add the stock mixture to the pan. Cook and stir until the mixture boils and thickens. Serve the gravy with the beef.", "A quick way to determine doneness is to use an instant-read thermometer. Insert the instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the beef to check the temperature. Look for a final temperature of 135 degrees F. for medium-rare and 160 degrees F. for medium, but make sure you consider that the temperature will rise 5-to 10-degrees during the stand time.", "Allstars are loyal Allrecipes community members, selected to be brand ambassadors based on onsite participation, interest, and commitment.
