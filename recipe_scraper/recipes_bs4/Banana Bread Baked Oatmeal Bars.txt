For the best flavor use a very ripe banana. Any fruit can be substituted for the banana, including dried fruit (cranberries!) and nuts. The bars are great the next day, too. Once cool, put the bars into the fridge, then pop them in the microwave for a few seconds before eating.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking dish.", "Beat applesauce and white sugar together in a bowl. Add oats, milk, eggs, baking powder, and salt to applesauce mixture; beat until evenly mixed. Stir banana into oat mixture. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.", "Stir brown sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl; sprinkle mixture over banana batter.", "Bake in the preheated oven until firm, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before slicing into bars.", "You can still make this with a just-ripe banana or any other low sugar fruit, but you'll probably need to add some brown sugar and vanilla to bump up the flavor."], "nutrition facts": "300 calories; protein 9.4g; carbohydrates 55.2g; fat 5.4g; cholesterol 66.1mg; sodium 322.7mg"}
