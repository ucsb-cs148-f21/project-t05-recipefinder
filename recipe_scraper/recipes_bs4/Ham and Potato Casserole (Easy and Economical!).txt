I assume it is Irish, because it was from that side of the family, and it also makes a LOT! Fortunately, it is excellent reheated (and better the next day, too!) My mother always made this with leftover holiday ham, which makes it even more economical. Can be baked in the oven (very slow!) or cooked on the stovetop (my preferred choice).", "Grease a heavy pot or Dutch oven.", "Layer about 1/3 of the potatoes into the bottom of the prepared pot.", "Spread 1/2 of the luncheon meat on top.", "Sprinkle with about 1/2 of the margarine and about 1/3 of the salt. Repeat the steps once more, then layer the remaining potatoes and margarine on top. Season with salt.", "Pour milk over potato mixture and cover.", "Heat pot over medium-high heat until milk begins to bubble, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.", "I personally prefer to cook this on the stovetop, as it gets done a LOT faster, but it does have the disadvantage of possibly burning the potatoes onto the bottom if you turn the heat too high. Just don't try to scrape too hard on the bottom when you are serving it up!", "Peel and slice potatoes fairly thin if you will be baking the casserole. Cook for about an hour at 375 degrees (check with a fork after 45 minutes.)"], "nutrition facts": "332 calories; protein 10.7g; carbohydrates 41.4g; fat 14.4g; cholesterol 27.5mg; sodium 1875.1mg"}
