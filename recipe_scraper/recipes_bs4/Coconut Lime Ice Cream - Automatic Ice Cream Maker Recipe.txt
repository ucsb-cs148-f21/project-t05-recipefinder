{"name": "Coconut Lime Ice Cream - Automatic Ice Cream Maker Recipe", "prep": "30 mins", "additional": "3 hrs", "total": "3 hrs 30 mins", "servings": "8", "yield": "8 servings", "ingredients": ["2 (14 ounce) cans unsweetened coconut milk", "1 cup white sugar", "2 tablespoons white sugar", "1 cup half-and-half, chilled", "5 tablespoons lime juice", "1 tablespoon lime zest", "1 pinch salt", "2 mangoes - peeled, seeded, and sliced", "1 lime, thinly sliced"], "steps": ["This recipe is fast, refreshing and delicious! NOTE: You'll want to halve this recipe if you are using a Cuisinart\u00ae or similar 1-1/2 automatic ice cream maker, like I do.", "Whisk coconut milk, sugar, half-and-half, lime juice, lime zest, and salt together in a bowl until sugar dissolves. Transfer coconut mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches 'soft-serve' consistency.", "Transfer ice cream to a lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer for at least 3 hours or overnight.", "Scoop ice cream into stemmed glasses or bowls. Garnish with mango and and lime slices.", "Taste test before placing in machine, so you'll have an idea if the recipe needs more lime or sugar to suit your taste. I often substitute half and half for 2% milk or vanilla soy milk. I have even used canned evaporated milk (chilled) - NOT the non-fat version. The less fat, of course, the more icy the resulting product will be. Lemon would probably work equally well, in place of lime."], "nutrition facts": "371 calories; protein 3.2g; carbohydrates 40.4g; fat 24.5g; cholesterol 11.2mg; sodium 26.3mg"}
