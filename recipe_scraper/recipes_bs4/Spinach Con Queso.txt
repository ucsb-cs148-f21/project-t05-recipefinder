It has a little kick, but not enough to make your eyes water. Of course, for the heat lovers, you can kick it up a notch if desired. This has become an instant family-favorite and one of my most requested appetizers.", "Heat olive oil and butter together in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion until translucent, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir red bell pepper and jalapeno pepper into onion mixture; cook until softened, about 5 minutes.", "Reduce heat to low and mix pepperjack cheese and spinach into onion mixture; cook, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and mixture is thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Slowly pour enough evaporated milk into cheese mixture, stirring constantly, until desired consistency is reached; season with salt. Continue to cook and stir over low heat until warmed through, at least 5 minutes more.", "If you want to have even more kick, chop the entire jalapeno with the veins and seeds.", "If you wish to use fresh spinach, I would recommend that you reduce it in a separate pot to avoid the excess moisture."], "nutrition facts": "255 calories; protein 13.2g; carbohydrates 8.2g; fat 19g; cholesterol 61.3mg; sodium 363.9mg"}
