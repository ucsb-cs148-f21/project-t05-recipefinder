I made this recipe up one afternoon and my family has been clamoring for these ever since! Really great flavors that meld together over the entire cooking time. They really are so good. They try to eat them right out of the pot! Serve with some hot sauce and vinegar on the side with your favorite meal. I promise you won't have any leftovers they are so good!", "Fill a large stockpot halfway with water; add vinegar, seafood seasoning, and olive oil. Bring liquid to a boil.", "Drain water from greens and mash garlic cloves; season with salt and pepper.", "You can easily prepare more collards than this - just make sure there is more water in your pot.", "I also use my Cuisinart(R) Dutch oven to make these. Put all ingredients in Dutch oven about 1/3 full of water in a 250 degree F (121 degrees C) preheated oven for about 3 hours. Cover Dutch oven completely with lid. Check partway through cooking that more water isn't needed.", "White vinegar or white wine vinegar can be used in place of apple cider vinegar.", "Depending on your tolerance you can remove jalapeno peppers or you can dice them up and add to the collards (my favorite way)."], "nutrition facts": "59 calories; protein 2g; carbohydrates 5.3g; fat 3.7g; sodium 438.5mg"}
