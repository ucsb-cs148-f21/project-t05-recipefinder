Fresh-picked basil and tomatoes with just a hint of seasoning. I always use a whole spelt loaf when I make this recipe. The notes of the spelt combine perfectly with the light/summery flavors of the other ingredients. Very earthy. Also, fresh ground pepper and chunky sea salt make this dish pop even more. Muah!", "Drizzle each slice of bread evenly with truffle oil and cover 4 bread slices with slices of buffalo mozzarella cheese, basil leaves, and tomato slices. Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper. Top each sandwich with a remaining bread slice."], "nutrition facts": "375 calories; protein 18.1g; carbohydrates 26.6g; fat 21.2g; cholesterol 44.6mg; sodium 431.7mg"}
