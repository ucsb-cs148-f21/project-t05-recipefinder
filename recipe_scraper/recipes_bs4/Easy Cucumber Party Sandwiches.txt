Can be prepared ahead of time and assembled just before serving. This is an easy appetizer to prepare the day before, except for the assembly. The cream cheese mixture is actually better after about 8 hours. Feel free to experiment with the dressing; we prefer the buttermilk dressing but ranch or Italian works great, too. Also, cocktail bread can be substituted for the hand-cut bread, which will save 10 to 15 minutes.", "Mix cream cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, ranch dressing mix, and dried dill in a bowl until creamy and smooth.", "Cut crusts from bread slices; cut sliced bread into decorative shapes (such as rounds or flowers) with cookie cutters.
