These are great to serve with your favorite burger, hot dog, or Tex-Mex dish. They make a snazzy addition to salads too! These are so addictive; I buy more underripe avocados than I do ripe ones now. I reuse the brine over and over. The brine can be reused by simply adding more avocados and allowing them to rest for 24 hours before consuming. These will last about 5 days in the refrigerator.", "Combine vinegar and water in a saucepan. Stir in sugar and salt; add mustard seeds, dill, peppercorns, and habanero pepper flakes.
