{"name": "Nuclear Chocolate Ice Cream", "prep": "20 mins", "cook": "15 mins", "additional": "6 hrs 30 mins", "total": "6 hrs 65 mins", "servings": "10", "yield": "10 servings", "ingredients": ["2 cups milk", "\u2154 cup white sugar", "3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder", "1 teaspoon instant espresso powder", "1 pinch salt", "4 egg yolks", "3\u2009\u00bd ounces dark chocolate", "2 cups heavy whipping cream", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"], "steps": ["This is the most chocolate, most rich, densest, custard-style ice cream ever devised. It's spiked with coffee flavor and with such a powerful taste, it earns the name Nuclear.", "Heat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, espresso powder, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until milk is barely simmering.", "Beat egg yolks in a bowl; gradually stir in about 1/2 cup hot milk mixture. Beat until smooth. Transfer egg yolk mixture back to the saucepan and continue cooking and stirring until thickened, about 5 minutes.", "Meanwhile, melt dark chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes.", "Remove saucepan from heat and stir melted chocolate into milk-egg mixture; transfer mixture to a large bowl, cover, and refrigerate until well-chilled, 4 hours to overnight.", "Stir cream and vanilla extract into chilled chocolate mixture and pour into an ice cream maker. Freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches \"soft-serve\" consistency. Transfer ice cream to a lidded container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should be placed in the freezer at least 2 hours or overnight.", "I use a Lindt(R) Special Dark Chocolate bar in this recipe. Dark chocolate chips are nearly as good. I have an in-pan mixer, so I mix this custard furiously at every stage (taste it right along; you may want to increase sugar slightly or adjust coffee up or down). I freeze the mixture in my Donvier(R) ice cream freezer, 1-quart size. Try it! It will knock your socks off."], "nutrition facts": "319 calories; protein 4.5g; carbohydrates 24g; fat 23.8g; cholesterol 151.5mg; sodium 42.3mg"}
