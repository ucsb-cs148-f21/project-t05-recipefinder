I tried it with jelly on the inside, but I couldn't taste it, so I just decided to leave the jelly out. The bananas still stay in between the bread without it. It's very delicious and low-fat as well. It doesn't even need syrup.", "Combine egg substitute, soy milk, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a shallow dish.", "Overlap banana slices over 1 slice of bread. Place second slice of bread on top and press down so sandwich holds together. Dip sandwich in egg mixture and coat both sides.", "Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat; spray with cooking spray. Place sandwich in hot skillet and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Flip it over carefully and cook second side until browned, about 3 minutes more.", "Choose a brand of light or regular whole wheat bread that is not too soft."], "nutrition facts": "284 calories; protein 12.8g; carbohydrates 52.1g; fat 3.7g; cholesterol 0.3mg; sodium 332.2mg"}
