Simply line your cookie sheets with parchment paper between baking each batch of cookies. After each freshly baked batch is done and ready to cool, you can easily slide the sheet of parchment with the cookies still on top, onto a cooling rack. That way you don't have to spend time carefully transferring each cookie, one at a time, onto the rack. You can save even more time by having the next batch of dough prepped on another sheet of parchment and ready to slide onto the cookie sheet so it can go right back into the oven."], "nutrition facts": "181 calories; protein 1.6g; carbohydrates 22.4g; fat 9.8g; cholesterol 32mg; sodium 144.5mg"}
