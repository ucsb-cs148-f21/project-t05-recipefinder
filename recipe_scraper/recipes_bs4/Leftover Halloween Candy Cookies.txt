You can use pretty much any chocolate candy bar: Snickers\u00ae, Milky Way\u00ae, Heath\u00ae, Almond Joy\u00ae, Rolos\u00ae, chocolate bars, etc. Whatever candy you use, these cookies will taste just like them!", "Melt candy bars, sugar, and butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and cool slightly, about 5 minutes.", "Beat in eggs, one at at time, until smooth. Mix in flour and baking soda to create a sticky dough.", "Chill dough in the refrigerator until it can be easily scooped, about 1 hour.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets with cooking spray.", "Roll 1 1/2 teaspoonful of dough into balls. Place onto prepared baking sheets 1 inch apart.", "Bake in the preheated oven until brown and fluffy, 10 to 12 minutes.", "More chopped candy can be added to the batter in step 2 if desired.", "If the dough is too hard after being refrigerated, let thaw until workable. If your dough is too cold, the cookie won't spread enough and you'll need to flatten the balls before baking.", "These are soft, chewy cookies. If you want cakey cookies, chill dough longer and bake for less time so that the cookies won't spread as much while baking."], "nutrition facts": "115 calories; protein 1.5g; carbohydrates 16g; fat 5.2g; cholesterol 18.8mg; sodium 61.5mg"}
