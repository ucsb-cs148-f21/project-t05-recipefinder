I have tried many recipes over the years and adjusted them and this is the result. Please do use the wine, most of the alcohol dissipates with the cooking.", "Combine steak seasoning, salt, thyme, and rosemary together in a bowl; rub onto the roast.", "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and place roast in skillet; cook until roast is browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.", "Place the roast in the slow cooker and add au jus mix and onion soup mix. Pour water and Malbec over roast.", "Cook on High for 5 hours (or cook in Low for 8 to 9 hours).", "Please adjust the salt in the mix to your taste, start out with a bit less than the amount called for and add more later. I have found the amount was just right for my liking.", "Strain the gravy and thicken with a flour slurry if necessary. This recipe makes a lot of good gravy.", "Since I had time I seared the pot roast, but I am thinking that in a time crunch it won't be necessary.", "For the wine, I used an Australian Malbec. But please, use any red wine that you would drink. Dornfelder, Merlot, Pinot Noir or Zinfandel would also very equal substitutes.", "For all DIYers: any homemade season mix can be easily substituted for the store-bought ones. Allrecipes has many to choose from.", "For other tasty additions: add pearl onions, peas, carrots,or potatoes.
