{"name": "Rick's Yummy Split Pea Soup with Ham", "prep": "30 mins", "cook": "2 hrs 15 mins", "additional": "3 hrs", "total": "5 hrs 45 mins", "servings": "8", "yield": "8 servings", "ingredients": ["1 (14 ounce) bag green split peas, rinsed", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "1\u2009\u00bd cups finely chopped onion", "1\u2009\u00bd cups finely chopped carrots", "1 cup finely chopped celery", "1 teaspoon minced garlic, or to taste", "7 cups chicken broth, or more as needed, divided", "1 bay leaf, or more to taste", "\u00bd teaspoon freshly ground black pepper", "\u00bc teaspoon ground thyme", "2 pounds smoked pork neck bones (such as Smithfield\u00ae)", "10 ounces cubed smoked ham (such as Carolina Pride\u00ae)"], "steps": ["I created this recipe when I did not have a ham bone laying around and was really needing some good split pea soup. Serve a hot bowl of this soup with a nice crusty bread of your choice. I did not add any salt to this recipe due to the ham, but you can add salt as needed.", "Place the split peas into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand for at least 3 hours. Rinse peas until the water runs clear; drain.", "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion, carrots, and celery in hot oil until soft, 8 to 12 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute.", "Combine peas, onion mixture, 6 cups chicken broth, bay leaf, black pepper, and thyme together in a large pot. Stir neck bones into chicken broth mixture, adding more chicken broth as necessary to cover bones completely. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and simmer until peas have dissolved and meat is falling from the bones, 2 to 3 hours. Transfer bones to a plate to cool.", "Stir cubed ham into soup. When neck bones are cool enough to handle, remove remaining meat from the bones; discard bones and stir meat into soup. Continue to simmer until ham and meat are heated through, about 5 minutes.", "If mixture is too thick add some more chicken stock. If it's too thin, simmer with cover off until desired consistency is reached.", "Also, if you want the mixture to be smooth: when you remove the neck bones, it is the time to get out the boat motor (or blender) and puree the soup."], "nutrition facts": "562 calories; protein 52.7g; carbohydrates 36.8g; fat 22g; cholesterol 116.2mg; sodium 2088.5mg"}
