This creamy cheese sauce is not only dairy-free, but extremely yummy and a great base recipe. You can do just about anything with it! Add a dash of cumin for that smoky Cheddar taste for mac and cheese, add more garlic, butter, and parsley for Alfredo, or add a can of tomatoes and green chiles to make that staple queso dip! It bakes well, too. Try chicken spaghetti with this creamy cheese sauce!", "Mix nutritional yeast, flour, garlic powder, onion powder, ground mustard, and salt together in a bowl. Pour in soy milk; whisk until smooth.", "Melt margarine in a saucepan over medium heat. Pour in soy milk mixture; cook, whisking constantly, until thickened into a sauce, about 5 minutes. Simmer until flavors combine, 1 to 2 minutes more.", "Substitute rice milk for the soy milk if desired.", "This sauce is meant to be rather thick, but extremely flexible. If it is too thick for what you intend to make, then add more of your milk or water to thin it out. Like Velveeta(R), this creamy sauce likes to thicken and clump when it cools. To fix this, just pop it in the microwave and reheat. I have heard that it tastes better the next day. However, mine has never stuck around long enough to find out!"], "nutrition facts": "235 calories; protein 13.7g; carbohydrates 25g; fat 9.7g; sodium 212.5mg"}
