This replaces cup-for-cup any recipe calling for Classic Bisquick\u00ae, not recipes calling for the gluten-free version of Bisquick\u00ae. Classic Bisquick\u00ae has fats in the mix whereas, the gluten-free version does not. My recipe contains oil and needs to be refrigerated after being mixed. It will last up to one week in an airtight container in the fridge.
