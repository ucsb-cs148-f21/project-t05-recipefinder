Transfer sausage slices to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.", "Roll pizza dough out to about 12 inches in diameter and about 3/8-inch thick; sprinkle with cornmeal. Flip dough so the cornmeal side is down and transfer to a perforated 14-inch pizza pan.", "Spread pizza sauce in a thin layer on top of the dough.
