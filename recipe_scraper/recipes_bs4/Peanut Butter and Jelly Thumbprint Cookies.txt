I usually double the recipe when I make them. Using a cookie scoop and soda bottle cap to make the indentations results in uniform cookies, which makes a nice presentation. But you can improvise with other lids; just aim for something about the size of a quarter. Use any variety of jelly, but I do not recommend jelly with chunks of fruit, like strawberry. Attempting to move the cookies prior to cooling completely will cause them to break.", "Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.", "Beat butter, peanut butter, white sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla together in a separate bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes.
