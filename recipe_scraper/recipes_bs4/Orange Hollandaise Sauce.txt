{"name": "Orange Hollandaise Sauce", "prep": "15 mins", "cook": "8 mins", "total": "23 mins", "servings": "6", "yield": "1 1/2 cup", "ingredients": ["4 egg yolks", "6 tablespoons fresh orange juice, divided", "\u00be cup butter, cut into 1/4-inch slices, at room temperature", "\u215b teaspoon salt, or to taste", "\u215b teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste"], "steps": ["This is an amazing twist on hollandaise sauce! You will love it!", "Place egg yolks and 1/4 cup orange juice in a heatproof bowl or in a double boiler set over simmering water, whisking constantly until warm and just starting to thicken, 1 to 2 minutes. Add butter, 1 slice at a time, whisking each addition until fully incorporated. Continue to whisk until sauce is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.", "Remove from heat and season with salt and black pepper. Thin sauce with remaining 2 tablespoons orange juice to reach desired consistency.", "Make the sauce over simmering water instead of over direct heat; too much heat will only cook the egg yolk rather than thicken the sauce. A bowl rather than the top pan of a double boiler makes whisking the sauce easier. Finally, softened butter blends in more readily than the more commonly used melted butter.", "To prevent a skin from forming on top of the sauce, cover sauce loosely with a paper towel and set over pan of warm water until ready to serve."], "nutrition facts": "246 calories; protein 2.1g; carbohydrates 2.1g; fat 26g; cholesterol 197.6mg; sodium 57.1mg"}
