Who would have thought that leafy green chips loaded with nutrients could be so addictive?

Make sure to keep an eye on them to make sure they don't burn; if you notice certain chips ready much sooner than others, take them out.", "The best way to bake these is by using a food dehydrator, where you just lay them on the sheets and wait until they are nice and crispy, and they are raw, meaning that none of the nutrients are lost.
