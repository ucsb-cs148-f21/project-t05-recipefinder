{"name": "Chef John's Salami Bread", "prep": "1 min", "cook": "25 mins", "additional": "1 hr 30 mins", "total": "1 hr 56 mins", "servings": "6", "yield": "1 (4-inch) loaf", "ingredients": ["1 (14 ounce) package prepared unbaked pizza dough", "8 slices salami, or more to form 2 rows", "\u00bc cup tomato sauce, or other crushed tomato product", "\u00bd cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or more to cover", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley", "1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano", "2 teaspoons olive oil, or as needed"], "steps": ["What started out as a frustrating attempt to test some pizza dough, turned into what we're calling salami bread. It would make a great Italian submarine sandwich, or just load it up with lots of Italian cheeses and fresh and pickled vegetables.", "Generously flour a work surface. Flatten out dough to form a rough rectangle. Flour top surface and roll out to a 1/4- to 1/2-inch thickness.", "Leaving an inch or so of the long edge uncovered, arrange salami slices in a single row without overlapping them. Create 2 single-layer rows, leaving a wider uncovered edge on the other side. Spread tomato sauce over salami. Generously cover with grated cheese, parsley, and oregano. Brush edges of dough with water.", "Begin rolling from the long edge closest to the salami. Roll fairly tightly without pressing or stretching dough too much to allow it room to rise, pinching in the ends as you go. Finish with seam side down. Carefully transfer roll to a rimmed baking sheet lined with a silicon mat. Cover with a dry towel and allow to rise until doubled, 60 to 90 minutes.", "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).", "Lightly brush top and sides of loaf with olive oil. Cut 1-inch deep slits diagonally across the top of the loaf, about 2 inches apart. Dust with grated Parmesan cheese.", "Bake in preheated oven on center rack until nicely browned and cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer loaf to a cooling rack. Cool completely before slicing.", "You can also cut a few 3/4-inch diagonal slices and brown them over medium-high heat in a bit of olive oil to make crostini. I served my crostini with a green salad topped with a fried egg. Delicious!"], "nutrition facts": "366 calories; protein 17.3g; carbohydrates 33.7g; fat 17.2g; cholesterol 43.7mg; sodium 1356.7mg"}
