So I've decided to take one of my favorite burritos from there, the cheeseburger burrito and apply it to quesadilla form. Served with a side of fries and a Coke\u00ae, it's what I call my most recent of culinary triumphs. Serve with a side of ketchup, yellow mustard, and sweet relish.", "Heat butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Add ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder; cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes.
