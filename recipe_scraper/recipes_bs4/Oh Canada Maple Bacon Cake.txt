Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans.", "Stir cake mix, water, oil, and eggs together in a large bowl until moistened; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes. Pour cake mixture into prepared pans.", "Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes; cool completely, about 30 minutes.", "Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. When cool enough to handle, crumble bacon into a small bowl.", "Beat butter until creamy with an electric mixer in a bowl; slowly beat in 2 cups confectioners' sugar until well blended. Beat maple syrup and vanilla extract into butter mixture until smooth and creamy; beat in remaining confectioners' sugar as needed until frosting mixture is a spreadable consistency. Fold crumbled bacon into frosting.", "Place one cake layer on a serving plate; spread about 1/2 cup bacon frosting evenly over cake.

Sprinkle the open area with red sugar; gently remove the paper stencil.", "You can add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon maple extract to the frosting for more intense maple flavour. You could do the same to the cake batter. I would recommend cutting the bacon in half or thirds before wrapping it on!", "You can make this as a 4-layer cake also. Slice cake layers horizontally in half using a long piece of dental floss or strong thread. You will also need to increase the amount of frosting you make by 50%.", "I've wrapped bacon around the outside of the cake for decoration. You'll need an additional 5 slices bacon. I recommend cutting the bacon strips in half or in thirds to make cutting the cake easier."], "nutrition facts": "518 calories; protein 5.1g; carbohydrates 62.3g; fat 28.5g; cholesterol 92.2mg; sodium 366.3mg"}
