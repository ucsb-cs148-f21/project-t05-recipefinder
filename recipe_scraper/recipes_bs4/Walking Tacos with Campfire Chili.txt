Perfect for picnics, block parties, camp-outs and game nights.

Season beef chuck and pork shoulder generously with salt. Cook in the hot oil in batches until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch.", "Stir onions, jalapeno chile pepper, and garlic into the Dutch oven; cook until soft, 3 to 5 minutes.
