I put 1/4 cup of bell peppers. Really I just use a 1/4 of the pepper, I'm not so concerned with exact measurements on this one. I like to have the spinach/lettuce on the bottom, then arrange the rest in piles around the rim of the bowl. It really displays the colors. The picture displayed doesn't have all the ingredients, but it has many to give you an idea of how pretty it turns out. This salad is quite colorful and goes with just about any dressing!"], "nutrition facts": "159 calories; protein 5.9g; carbohydrates 11.6g; fat 11.3g; cholesterol 106mg; sodium 124.9mg"}
