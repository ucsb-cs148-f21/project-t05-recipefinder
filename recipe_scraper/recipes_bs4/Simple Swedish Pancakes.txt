This is the recipe I grew up with (I added the nutmeg as I like nutmeg). I love these and make them for family brunches all the time. They even taste good as leftovers, as pancakes again, or with peanut butter instead. We serve these with just syrup and butter, but many use lingonberries, or other fruit or jams.", "Combine milk, eggs, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour, sugar, salt, and nutmeg in a blender; blend until batter is smooth.", "Heat a seasoned griddle over medium-high heat. Ladle 1/4 to 1/2 cup of batter onto the griddle and spread thinly. Cook until top looks barely dry, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Slide a long, thin spatula under pancake to loosen edges; flip. Continue cooking until just browned on the second side, about 1 minute more.", "Roll up pancakes and serve a few at a time.", "My Grandma always stated that they weren't real Swedish pancakes if not made on a cast iron griddle. They can also be made with a plett pan, which makes silver dollar pancakes. Both are traditional methods. Crepe pans work well, as do electric nonstick griddles.", "The pancakes can be kept in a warm oven preheated to 175 degrees F (80 degrees C) until all are done and ready to serve."], "nutrition facts": "228 calories; protein 11.6g; carbohydrates 30.1g; fat 6.5g; cholesterol 149.3mg; sodium 200mg"}
