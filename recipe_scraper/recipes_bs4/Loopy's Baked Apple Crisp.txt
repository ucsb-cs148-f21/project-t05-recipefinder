{"name": "Loopy's Baked Apple Crisp", "prep": "10 mins", "cook": "45 mins", "total": "55 mins", "servings": "2", "yield": "2 servings", "ingredients": ["cooking spray", "\u00bc cup cream cheese, softened", "2 tablespoons brown sugar", "2 tablespoons maple syrup", "2 tablespoons chopped walnuts", "1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons ground cinnamon", "\u00bc teaspoon vanilla extract", "\u215b teaspoon ground nutmeg", "\u215b teaspoon ground allspice", "1 apple, halved and core cut out", "1 tablespoon butter", "\u00bc cup granola"], "steps": ["I created this recipe myself, and it's the first one I'm submitting to the site. The cream cheese mixture turns almost into a caramel sauce when baked, not 'cream-cheesy' at all. This is delicious by itself, or it would be great served with vanilla ice cream or maybe pancakes or waffles, which would also turn this recipe's yield into 4 to 6 servings.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8x8-inch baking dish with cooking spray.", "Stir cream cheese, brown sugar, maple syrup, walnuts, cinnamon, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and allspice together in a bowl until well mixed.", "Place apples, cut-side up, into baking dish, supporting them with pieces from the core underneath if needed. Spoon 1 1/2 teaspoons butter into each cored apple and top each with 1/2 the cream cheese mixture, filling the hole and covering the entire top of apple.", "Bake in the preheated oven until apples are slightly softened, about 35 minutes. Sprinkle apples with granola, pressing granola into filling. Continue baking until apples are cooked through and granola is browned, about 10 more minutes.", "An alternative baking method might be to follow directions as written, but bake the apple for 40 to 45 minutes or until cooked through, then add the granola, press in lightly, and put under broiler 1 to 2 minutes or until brown and crispy on top. Omit or change the type of nuts. Try pancake syrup or honey instead of maple syrup. Add some raisins or minced ginger. Increase the cinnamon. Make your own crispy topping instead of using granola. Whatever changes work for you based on your preferences and what you have on hand."], "nutrition facts": "423 calories; protein 5.9g; carbohydrates 47.8g; fat 24.8g; cholesterol 47.2mg; sodium 137.3mg"}
