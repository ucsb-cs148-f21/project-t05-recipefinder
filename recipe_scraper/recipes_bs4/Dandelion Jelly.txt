Send your little dandelion picker out to the yard and make some jelly together. This jelly is amazingly sweet and flavorful. The flavor would best be described as tasting like fresh honey.", "Heat water in a large pot until simmering. Add 2 cups dandelion petals; simmer for 10 minutes. Remove petals with a slotted spoon and strain over a bowl; squeeze out as much liquid from them as possible. Discard petals. Repeat with remaining 2 cups petals.", "Measure out 3 cups of dandelion-infused water, adding tap water to make up the difference if needed, and pour into a large pot. Add lemon juice, pectin, and yellow food coloring; bring to a rolling boil. Add sugar; return to a boil. Cook, stirring constantly, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and skim foam off the surface if needed.", "Pour mixture into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any residue. Top with lids and screw on rings.", "Place a rack in the bottom of a large pot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars, 2 inches apart, into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 7 minutes.", "Remove the jars from the pot and place on a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart. Press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight. Let cool, about 24 hours.", "You will need about a gallon pail full of blossoms - use ones that are large, bright, and dry. Remove the yellow petals, being careful not to use the green parts (which can be bitter), and discarding the stems. Pulling the petals from the blossoms is a bit tedious, but make sure you use enough petals. More petals equals more flavor."], "nutrition facts": "90 calories; protein 0.2g; carbohydrates 23.1g; sodium 4.8mg"}
