We love hot peppers and always make a lot of these from the ones we grow in our garden every year.", "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper.", "Bake until the peppers are just tender, 20 to 30 minutes.", "If you aren't a fan of taco seasoning, try stuffing the peppers with a mixture of cream cheese, mozzarella, and chopped pepperoni. Or try cream cheese, bleu cheese, and a bit of dry ranch dressing mix, or whatever sounds good to you!", "They also keep quite well if baked for about 15 minutes and cooled before freezing on a baking sheet and then stored in resealable freezer bags. Bake frozen poppers for about 20 minutes."], "nutrition facts": "116 calories; protein 4.1g; carbohydrates 3g; fat 9.9g; cholesterol 30.7mg; sodium 204.7mg"}
