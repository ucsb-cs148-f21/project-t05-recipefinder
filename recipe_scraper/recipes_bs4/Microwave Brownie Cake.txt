It's super easy to make and to memorize, and if you only use one mug, a tablespoon measure, and a spoon, you have a lot fewer dishes to do. Easy to make in under 5 minutes with minimal mess, so enjoy! And never feel bad about eating the entire thing yourself.", "Microwave chocolate chips and butter in a microwave-safe mug until melted, about 20 seconds. Add brown sugar, white sugar, salt, baking soda, and vanilla extract; mix together until combined. Stir in egg yolk. Add flour; mix until batter is blended and smooth.", "Cook in the microwave until crust forms but center is still fudgy, about 35 seconds. Add 5 to 10 seconds for a drier consistency.", "This recipe is enough for one 1/2 cup serving of cake (roughly) or two 1/4 cup mug cakes, doled into separate mugs after mixing.", "Do not use more baking soda than recommended. The cake will rise too much.", "You will need to soak whatever mug you use - this stuff dries on pretty tough.
