Cook and stir onions and celery in the hot butter until onions are translucent, about 8 minutes; remove from heat.", "Place a plastic slow cooker liner into a 6-quart slow cooker. Place dry bread stuffing into the liner bag and sprinkle contents of seasoning packet over the bread.

Mix another half-cup of pot liquor with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch; add to the skillet, stirring until it incorporates and thickens. Taste gravy for seasoning.
