Turn off the heat and add margarine and cream cheese, breaking them into smaller pieces as you stir them into the squash mixture; remove the saucepan from heat. Stir kernel corn and 1 can cream-style corn through the squash mixture.", "Stir remaining can of cream-style corn, dry corn muffin mix, eggs, and sugar in a large bowl until thoroughly mixed.
