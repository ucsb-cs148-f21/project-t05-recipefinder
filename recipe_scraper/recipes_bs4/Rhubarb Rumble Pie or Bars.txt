I have to give thanks to Nikki for adapting this recipe! Even my son who dislikes rhubarb loves this one. Adapted from the diabetic/diet version (Rhubarb Rumble). I like to make this in an 11x7-inch (2-quart) glass pan, making my own graham cracker crust. The addition of fresh strawberries adds an extra layer of lusciousness. It ends up being a very PRETTY IN PINK dessert. The hard part is waiting for it to chill.", "Combine rhubarb and strawberry gelatin mix in a large microwave-safe glass bowl. Cover bowl and cook rhubarb mixture on high until rhubarb is very soft and has cooked down into threads, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir every 2 minutes. Let mixture cool.", "Stir skim milk and vanilla pudding mix in a bowl until moistened. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until thickened, about 2 minutes; stir cooled rhubarb mixture into pudding mixture.", "Spread strawberry slices into the bottom of prepared graham cracker crust. Spoon rhubarb pudding mixture over strawberries and refrigerate dessert until firm, about 1 hour.", "Any of the following pan sizes would work if making own crust: 6-cup baking dish or pan; 13x10-inch rectangular pan; 13x8-inch rectangular pan; 9x12-inch rectangular pan; 9x9-inch square pan; deep-dish or regular 10-inch round pie plate."], "nutrition facts": "226 calories; protein 4.1g; carbohydrates 41.6g; fat 5.6g; cholesterol 0.9mg; sodium 357.6mg"}
