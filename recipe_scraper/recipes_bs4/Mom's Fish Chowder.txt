{"name": "Mom's Fish Chowder", "prep": "10 mins", "cook": "20 mins", "total": "30 mins", "servings": "4", "yield": "4 servings", "ingredients": ["2 tablespoons butter, or more to taste", "1 sweet onion (such as Vidalia\u00ae), diced", "1\u2009\u00bc cups water, divided", "1 pound cod fillets", "1 large russet potato, peeled and cut into cubes", "salt and ground black pepper to taste", "1 cup whole milk", "1 cup evaporated milk"], "steps": ["My mom's recipe for a simple fish chowder. Wonderful and quick on a cold night! Very versatile. Not a thick tastes-like-flour-paste chowder. Just yummmm! Mom served it with Bisquick\u00ae brown sugar rolls, but a salad with any bread, roll, or crackers would be equally perfect!", "Melt butter in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onions in hot butter until soft, about 5 minutes.", "Pour 1 cup water in the skillet and bring to a simmer. Lay fillets into the water and poach until fish flesh can be gently broken with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove fish and onions from the skillet with a slotted spoon to a bowl.", "Pour remaining 1/4 cup water into the skillet with the potato cubes; season with salt. Place a cover on the skillet and bring the liquid to a boil; cook until the potatoes are beginning to soften, but remain firm, 5 to 7 minutes.", "Return fish and onion to the skillet; add whole milk and evaporated milk. Season everything with salt and pepper; heat until just before the liquid comes to a boil and remove immediately from heat.", "It's important to use russet baking potato as it is starchy and will help thicken the chowder.", "Use 2 potatoes and 2 ribs of celery to stretch the soup for more people.", "You can also add imitation crabmeat and double all ingredients (except fish of course) for a yummy crab/fish chowder.", "Also feel free to exchange 1 cup clam juice for 1 cup water when expanding the recipe.", "Any firm, mild white fish can work in place of the cod."], "nutrition facts": "351 calories; protein 28.8g; carbohydrates 28.7g; fat 13.4g; cholesterol 88.3mg; sodium 249.1mg"}
