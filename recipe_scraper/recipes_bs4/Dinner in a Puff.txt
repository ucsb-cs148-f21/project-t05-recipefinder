{"name": "Dinner in a Puff", "prep": "15 mins", "cook": "10 mins", "total": "25 mins", "servings": "3", "yield": "3 servings", "ingredients": ["8 ounces frozen puff pastry, thawed", "6 tablespoons goat cheese", "3 tablespoons mashed avocado", "3 tablespoons jam", "1 sun-dried tomato, cut into 3 pieces", "2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts"], "steps": ["I found this idea on the internet and have fiddled around with different flavor combinations. The kids like these because I give each child a 6-cup muffin tin and each chooses what goes in their 6 cups. They usually make three savory and three sweet. These are quick and easy. If you don't have puff pastry then try pie crust, ready made biscuit dough or crescent dough. Easy dinner in a puff!", "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).", "Cut puff pastry into 6 equal squares about 4 inches diagonally and 1/4-inch thick. Push each square into a muffin cup and gently press down. Place 1 tablespoon goat cheese into each pastry. Spoon 1 tablespoon avocado into 3 of the pastries and 1 tablespoon jam into the other 3 pastries.", "Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Top the avocado puffs each with 1 slice sun-dried tomatoes. Sprinkle pine nuts over all the puffs.", "Gluten-free puff pastry can be used in place of regular puff pastry.", "Use any combos you like here. Go savory or go sweet or heck, go both. The idea is a fatty or soft cheese like gorgonzola or brie, a hard cheese won't melt properly. I use cranberry, fig, or any jam. I've also had much success with jalapeno jam and chutneys!", "I dip a shot glass in cornstarch and use that to press the puff pastry squares into the muffin cups before filling."], "nutrition facts": "580 calories; protein 10.4g; carbohydrates 50.5g; fat 38.1g; cholesterol 11.2mg; sodium 282.5mg"}
