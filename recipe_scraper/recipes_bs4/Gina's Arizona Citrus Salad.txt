I loved it so much I ran back to my hotel room and wrote down everything I could remember was in it. It's a beautiful salad with a light dressing and has lots of texture and color. The dressing took some experimenting, but I think it turned out just right.", "Blend olive oil, sugar, orange juice, poppy seeds, minced onion, Dijon mustard, orange zest, and salt in a blender until smooth.", "Toss salad greens, green onions, avocado, green apple, goat cheese, cranberries, golden raisins, mandarin oranges, and walnuts together in a large mixing bowl. Drizzle dressing over the salad; toss to coat.", "I would recommend putting just enough dressing (approximately 1/4 cup) on the salad ingredients. Too much salad dressing doesn't work very well."], "nutrition facts": "272 calories; protein 3.7g; carbohydrates 24.4g; fat 19.5g; cholesterol 7.5mg; sodium 165mg"}
