{"name": "Almond Flour", "prep": "10 mins", "total": "10 mins", "servings": "4", "yield": "4 servings", "ingredients": ["1 cup almonds, or as needed"], "steps": ["I use almond flour with many of my recipes but it is very costly. I want to experiment with a few inspirations for the holidays therefore decided to make my own almond flour. I had a huge bag that I purchased a while ago to make a nut crunch. I used my food processor but I bet you can do the same with a coffee grinder as well. My advice would be to pulse it because I fear if you over blend you will end up with almond butter. It came out perfectly so now off to cooking land!", "Place almonds, about 1/4 cup at a time, in the food processor. Pulse until you reach a flour-like consistency; sift into a container. Place any remaining almonds chunks back into food processor and pulse. Repeat until all almonds are transformed into flour. Cover container and store flour in refrigerator."], "nutrition facts": "205 calories; protein 7.5g; carbohydrates 7g; fat 18g; sodium 0.4mg"}
