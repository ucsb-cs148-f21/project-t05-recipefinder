The flavors of grated cheeses vary. Start with 1/3 cup, and then add more if desired. Serve risotto in 1-cup portions as a side dish or larger portions as a main dish. A pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc wine would make a lovely accompaniment.", "Wash asparagus and break off the tough ends. Cut spears into 1-inch pieces; set aside.", "In a 6-quart pot, melt butter with olive oil. Add onion, garlic and rice. Over medium-high heat, cook and stir 3-4 minutes; do not brown. Add cooking wine and broth. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Immediately reduce heat to low, cover and cook 10 minutes. No need to stir.", "Add asparagus and continue to cook and stir, uncovered, about 3 minutes. Taste rice to ensure it does not overcook. Rice should be al dente and rather soupy. Stir in cheese, lemon peel and marjoram. Remove from heat and serve immediately. Sprinkle with additional cheese, if desired.", "Traditional risotto is very creamy and the rice is firm to the bite. The rice will continue to absorb liquid as it sits.", "Use 2 cups fresh peas, or frozen peas (thawed), in place of asparagus.", "Add 1/2 cup diced ham or prosciutto along with the cheese, lemon and herb.", "Recipe may be halved; use a 4-quart saucepan."], "nutrition facts": "339 calories; protein 7.4g; carbohydrates 53.5g; fat 8g; cholesterol 13.1mg; sodium 749.4mg"}
