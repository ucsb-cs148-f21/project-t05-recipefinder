Lean, boneless, skinless chicken breasts are delicious as well.", "In a blender container, combine sherry cooking wine and remaining ingredients except meat. Cover and run on high until smooth.", "Trim steak of any visible fat. Place steak in a non-metallic baking dish or sealable plastic bag. Add marinade; turn meat to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight, turning meat one or more times while marinating.", "Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Drain meat and discard marinade. Grill skirt steak about 6 minutes over direct heat with cover closed. Turn meat; grill with cover closed 2 minutes more or until cooked as desired. Flank steak will take longer to cook.", "Slice steak into thin strips across the grain. Serve with warm corn tortillas, if desired.", "Cook time for skirt steak about 8 minutes; flank steak 12-14 minutes", "Use unseasoned tomato puree or crushed tomatoes, not tomato sauce.
