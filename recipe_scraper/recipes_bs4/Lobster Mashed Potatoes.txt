These potatoes were so delicious, I could have skipped the steak entirely. This is my take on this rich and decadent side dish. This has become one of our traditions on Valentine's Day with a fabulous tenderloin steak. YUMMY! This would work well with your own mashed potato recipe instead of the basic mashed potato recipe listed here. You could certainly do this recipe with lobster tails instead of the whole lobster. You could even use precooked lobster ignoring the lobster cooking instructions. It looks like it is time consuming, but it is so easy and worth the effort for a special meal.", "Preheat an oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).", "Combine the water with 2 tablespoons salt in a large pot; bring to a boil", "Plunge lobster into boiling water, cover the pot, and return the water to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook at a simmer until the lobster becomes bright right, about 10 minutes.", "Remove the lobster from the water and set aside to cool.", "When cool enough to handle, clean lobster and pull out tail meat, reserving the tail shell.
