This spring side dish is a great addition to any grilled meat meal.", "Melt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir the garlic briefly in the butter mixture, about 1 minute. Stir corn into butter and oil to coat; cook and stir until warmed, about 3 minutes. Pour milk into the skillet; bring to a simmer. Place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until hot, about 10 minutes.", "Remove the cover from the skillet and continue cooking until the liquid is mostly evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes. Add blue cheese; cook and stir until the cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes.", "The cheese will melt very quickly when added to the skillet. Do not add the cheese until ready to serve as it will become almost liquid if heated too much. Add additional milk if reheating contents (without the cheese) just before serving."], "nutrition facts": "249 calories; protein 9g; carbohydrates 25.2g; fat 14.3g; cholesterol 29.5mg; sodium 354mg"}
