After trying recipe after recipe that turned out either rock hard or thick gummy hard shells - I thought to read the ingredient list on a bottle of the store stuff and came up with this! You can use any oil that has NO flavor or has a flavor compatible with chocolate and your ice cream - canola or soybean work ok here, but the coconut oil sends the flavor over the top and makes it a tad crunchier! Drizzle on top of your favorite ice cream!", "Combine chocolate chips and coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave in 30-second intervals, mixing well each time, until mixture is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. It takes about 1 minute of stirring until they fully mix together. Store at room temperature in an air-tight container.", "Add more oil for thinner, crispier hard shell and add less for a thicker hard shell."], "nutrition facts": "89 calories; protein 0.4g; carbohydrates 6.6g; fat 7.7g; sodium 1.2mg"}
