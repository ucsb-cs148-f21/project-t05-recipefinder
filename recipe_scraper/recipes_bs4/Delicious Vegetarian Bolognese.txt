I've tried making vegetarian Bolognese many times but never really succeeded. This time it turned out really great and it's now one of my family's favorite meals. Lentils are not usually my daughter's favorite food but this Bolognese has been a huge success. Another plus about this recipe: it will be good the first day but even better the second day. So make a big batch and enjoy this Bolognese over a couple of days. Garnish with Parmesan cheese and serve with a salad.", "Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.
