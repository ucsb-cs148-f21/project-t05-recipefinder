Reduce the heat so the mixture bubbles occasionally.", "Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom and sides of the pan, until the polenta is thick and starts to pull away from the sides of the pan, 35 to 40 minutes.", "Remove from the heat. Stir in the butter, a few cubes at a time, then stir in the cheese. Keep warm over very low heat.", "Heat grapeseed oil in a large saute pan over medium heat.
