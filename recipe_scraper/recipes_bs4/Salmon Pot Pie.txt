I was thinking chicken pot pie but wanted to try something different, though along the same lines - served in a individual baking dish with a creamy sauce, and topped with puff pastry. Sounds like chicken pot pie but I wanted salmon! I looked at some fish pie recipes but nothing I found came in that familiar comforting form. So I set out on my own and this is what I came up with! Hope you enjoy it.", "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 2-cup baking dishes.", "Bring the clam juice to a simmer in a small pot. Place salmon fillet into clam juice; poach until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes. Remove salmon to a plate; reserve poaching liquid.", "Heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in carrot, celery, leek, and shallot; cook and stir until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.
