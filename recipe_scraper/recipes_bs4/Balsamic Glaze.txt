{"name": "Balsamic Glaze", "prep": "5 mins", "cook": "20 mins", "total": "25 mins", "servings": "10", "yield": "1 cup", "ingredients": ["2 cups balsamic vinegar", "\u00bd cup brown sugar"], "steps": ["This glaze is a must-have accompaniment to drizzle over fish, poultry, vegetables, pastas, salads, and even fruit. It can turn any dish from ordinary to extraordinary with its perfectly balanced, intense flavor of sweet and tangy. It adds a beautiful, deep pop of color to any dish to create a perfect, professional presentation. I make a large batch and have it on hand in the fridge at all times. Once you start adding this glaze to dishes you will become addicted and crave its intense flavor.", "Mix balsamic vinegar with brown sugar in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly until sugar has dissolved. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until glaze is reduced by half, about 20 minutes. Glaze should coat the back of a spoon. Let cool and pour into a jar with a lid; store in refrigerator.", "Substitute raspberry or any other flavored balsamic vinegar to suite your taste. Or instead of brown sugar, substitute molasses, honey, maple syrup or agave nectar. The flavor is intense and should be used as a drizzle. Some of my favorite ways to serve are with gorgonzola cheese and green onions on pasta or portobello mushrooms, on grilled beets and carrots, with salmon or pork, or as a dressing on salad with toasted nuts, dried cranberries or fresh strawberries."], "nutrition facts": "73 calories; protein 0.2g; carbohydrates 18.2g; fat 0.1g; sodium 15.4mg"}
