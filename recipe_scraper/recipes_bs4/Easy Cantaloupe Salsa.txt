The recipe was given to me by a friend and it always goes quickly. It's easy to double, and people always ask for the recipe so have extras on hand! I prefer fresh tomatoes, but the recipe calls for canned. You can also substitute any fruit to adjust it to your tastes. If you have a food processor or mini chopper, this recipe is much quicker and easier. Serve with Tostitos\u00ae Scoops!\u00ae chips. Enjoy!", "Mix cantaloupe, tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, yellow bell pepper, jalapeno peppers, lemon juice, lime juice, and garlic together in a bowl.
