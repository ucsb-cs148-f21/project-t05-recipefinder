With veggie toppings it's like a creamy risotto but smoother. This is the basic oatmeal recipe; use your favorite toppings and sauces, such as sliced avocado, sriracha sauce, chopped chard or greens, even a poached egg. So many possibilities!", "Pour milk and water into a saucepan; add salt. Stir in rolled oats and steel-cut oats. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low. Simmer until you get the consistency you like, about 20 minutes. The rolled oats will get creamy, while the steel-cut oats will have a luscious pop to them. Add more water at any time if it gets too thick. Serve.", "Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container. Reheat the next day with a little added water or milk..", "Cook's Note: Make the base oatmeal and then the fun starts! Lean it savory instead of sweet by adding a sliced hard-boiled egg or a fried egg or a poached egg if you're feeling fancy; chopped pickles, pickled chard stems, or pickled carrots; a sliced avocado; a dab or two of sriracha hot sauce; salt (if needed) and pepper or, once again if you're getting fancy, a sprinkling of cumin would be nice; saute some garlic in olive oil, add a bunch of chopped Swiss chard or kale greens and continue sauteing until they wilt."], "nutrition facts": "542 calories; protein 9.9g; carbohydrates 52g; fat 35.3g; sodium 1349mg"}
