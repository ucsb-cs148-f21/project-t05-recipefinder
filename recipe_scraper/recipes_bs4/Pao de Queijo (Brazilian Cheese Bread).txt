Last time I visited Brazil I was surprised to find cheese bread at the airport, offered along with American-brand pizza, though with a Brazilian brand that reminds us of this old Mineira tradition. (Minas-Gerais means the general mines, as this part of Brazil was the first where rich mines of gold, diamonds, emeralds, and other precious stones were found. It is also where one of the world's richest iron ore deposits are located.)", "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.", "Pour tapioca starch into a wide bowl.", "Combine 1 cup water, vegetable oil, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Slowly pour over the tapioca, mixing with a spoon until evenly combined. Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes.", "Stir Mexican cheese blend and eggs into the tapioca mixture.
