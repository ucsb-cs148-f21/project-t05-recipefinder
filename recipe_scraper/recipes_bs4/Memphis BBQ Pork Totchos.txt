Arrange potato nuggets in a single layer on a baking sheet.", "Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.

Then, I use a cleaver to chop it, and finally, I finish it in a grill pan, over high heat, adding more dry rub seasoning. I order the dry rub from Rendezvous in Memphis. Finishing it on the grill pan makes the meat crispy, mimicking the all-important \"bark\" formed on the outside of true barbeque. It also renders out some of the fat, so the pork isn't as rich.", "The potato nuggets should really be extra crispy so they don't sog out when buried in the toppings."], "nutrition facts": "619 calories; protein 31.7g; carbohydrates 57.2g; fat 32.1g; cholesterol 105.4mg; sodium 1674.8mg"}
