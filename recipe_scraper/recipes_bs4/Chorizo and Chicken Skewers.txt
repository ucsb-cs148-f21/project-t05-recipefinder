No matter the marinade or the delivery system, you will simply reach your limit, and that's when you need to reach for the chorizo. Impale a few slices of this famously delicious Spanish sausage in between your chunks of chicken. As it grills it will splatter its spicy, smokey fat all over its much blander skewer-mate, and once again you and grilled chicken will be good buddies.", "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.", "Place chicken and chorizo in a large bowl; add olive oil, sherry vinegar, oregano, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and salt. Stir until chicken and chorizo are completely coated.", "Thread chicken, chorizo, red onion, and red bell pepper evenly onto 4 skewers, making sure that each piece of chicken touches 1 piece of chorizo. Place finished skewers on a plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until cold 15 to 30 minutes.", "Cook on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes."], "nutrition facts": "372 calories; protein 26.1g; carbohydrates 5.6g; fat 26.6g; cholesterol 82.2mg; sodium 769.7mg"}
