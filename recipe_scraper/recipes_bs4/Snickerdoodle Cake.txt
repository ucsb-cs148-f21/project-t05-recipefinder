This recipe was actually a creative mistake. I was trying to make up a decadent chocolate cake, and had already added in the cinnamon, when I discovered that I was out of cocoa powder! I decided to continue to make this recipe and was shocked when it turned out! This recipe is pretty special to me because it was the very first recipe I actually made up myself. The honey in the frosting adds a hint of an interesting sweetness, even though with a teaspoon you can't taste it. For a more obvious honey flavor, add up to 1/3 cup (or to taste) of honey.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch cake pans with shortening and dust with about 1 teaspoon flour, shaking to remove excess flour.", "Beat 1/2 cup butter in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add white sugar and beat until incorporated into the creamed butter. Add eggs, 1 at a time, to creamed butter mixture, beating until thoroughly combined before adding the next egg. Stir 1 teaspoon vanilla extract into creamed butter mixture.", "Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Gradually beat 1/3 the flour mixture into butter mixture, alternating with the 3/4 cup milk and ending with flour mixture until batter is smooth. Pour batter into the prepared cake pans.", "Bake in the preheated oven until cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Turn cakes onto a wire rack to cool completely, at least 30 minutes.", "Beat 1/2 cup butter in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; beat in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and honey. Gradually beat enough confectioners' sugar into creamed butter mixture to reach desired consistency, adding 1 tablespoon milk if needed to thin the icing.", "Spread 1/3 the icing over the top of 1 cake using a spatula. Place the second cake over the icing layer and spread remaining icing over entire cake.", "If you don't mind the extra fat and calories, use 1 cup butter in the batter and about 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup milk in the batter. Substitute half-and-half for the milk if desired.", "You can also use the springs-back-to-the-touch test when checking to see if it is done.", "Use a 9x13-inch baking dish in place of the 2 cake pans if desired."], "nutrition facts": "509 calories; protein 5.4g; carbohydrates 76.3g; fat 21g; cholesterol 106.2mg; sodium 577.5mg"}
