Much to my dismay, I was out of chocolate chips and had one bag of peanut butter chips I didn't know what to do with. This recipe was (fortunately) a successful experiment as I crossed my favorite brownie and chocolate chip cookie recipes. My family likes it better than both. It tastes something like a peanut butter cup in cookie form.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).", "Beat butter, shortening, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the butter until completely blended, then beat in the vanilla with the second egg. Mix flour, baking powder, cocoa powder, and salt in another bowl; mix the flour mixture into the butter mixture until just incorporated. Fold in peanut butter chips, mixing just enough to evenly combine.", "Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.", "Bake in preheated oven until cookies are set, about 8 minutes.", "For nicer-looking cookies, reserve some of the chips and press 3 to 4 by hand into the top of each cookie. Not necessary, and takes a few extra minutes, but they look a lot nicer when they're done."], "nutrition facts": "149 calories; protein 3.1g; carbohydrates 18.6g; fat 6.9g; cholesterol 17.1mg; sodium 66.6mg"}
