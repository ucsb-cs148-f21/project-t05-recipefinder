Add your favorite vegan or gluten-free icing! I used an Oreo\u00ae icing, so it was vegan but not gluten-free.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.", "Whisk together gluten-free flour blend, sugar, cocoa powder baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.", "Mash banana in a bowl. Add cooled coffee, oil, almond milk, apple cider vinegar, and vanilla extract. Whisk until combined. Pour into flour mixture. Stir slowly until just combined; batter will be thick and gummy.", "Ladle batter into the lined muffin tin, filling cups 2/3 full.", "Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes.", "You can use a store-bought gluten-free flour blend or make your own. It is important to use a blend in order to make sure the cupcake will not be too dense (if you use only whole-grain flour) nor too gummy (if you use only white rice flour or starchy flours). I used a combination of 150 grams white rice flour, 150 grams corn starch, 100 grams almond meal, and 100 grams brown rice flour, all sifted together. This means my blend was 60% white flours (white rice and a starch) and 40% whole-grain/nut flours (almond and brown rice). You can experiment with bean flours, but the flavor of the bean may come through in the cooking.", "You can use decaf coffee if you prefer."], "nutrition facts": "185 calories; protein 3.2g; carbohydrates 34.2g; fat 5.3g; sodium 117.3mg"}
