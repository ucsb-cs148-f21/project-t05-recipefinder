Add a pinch more salt, if needed.", "This salsa will work with any stone fruit, but nectarines are my favorite. They're usually sweet, even when still a bit firm, which I prefer texturally over a perfectly ripe price of fruit. Having said that, if you do have a few peaches to use up this summer, this is something to keep in mind."], "nutrition facts": "33 calories; protein 0.5g; carbohydrates 4.5g; fat 1.7g; sodium 195mg"}
