I was always willing to indulge in as many as she would allow! Eventually her mother started packing extras! I've since lost her recipe, but this one produces the same delightful flavor and texture I relished as a kid. Enjoy for breakfast, lunch, or snack.", "Whisk flour, baking powder, nutmeg, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Mix spinach and onion together in a separate bowl. Add milk and eggs to spinach mixture; mix well. Stir flour mixture into spinach mixture until batter is evenly combined.", "Heat about 1 inch of oil in a large, deep frying pan over medium-high heat. Oil is ready to use with a drop of spinach batter added to the oil bubbles immediately.", "Drop batter, about 1 tablespoon per fritter, into the hot oil; fry until outside edges of fritters are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove fritters with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil as needed.", "Dehydrated minced onion (1 1/2 teaspoons) can be substituted for the raw onion if desired.", "I used unrefined virgin coconut oil, which made for lighter fritters that are free from any excess grease that didn't get blotted out.", "Due to cutting back on gluten, I used a mixture of regular and brown rice flours with a pinch of xanthan gum for the 3/4 cup flour. This did not affect the texture or taste in my opinion.", "We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking.
