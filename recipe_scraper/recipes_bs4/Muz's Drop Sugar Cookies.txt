First off, I'm a 22-year-old man and when I was in my teens, my great-grandmother, who I called Muz, would make sugar cookies all the time for me and my grandparents. They were phenomenal, as she had perfected it over the years. She passed at the young age of 95 in 2006 and left the recipe in one of her boxes. Now that I've been cooking, I found her recipe for her Drop Sugar Cookies last week and made them last night. They are awesome, but you'll learn that when you make them. Enjoy!", "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).", "Sift flour, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar, butter, shortening, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until thoroughly mixed; add egg and beat until creamy. Stir creamed mixture into flour mixture until smooth; stir in milk. Drop teaspoons of dough onto a baking sheet and flatten each with the bottom of a water glass. Sprinkle the tops of each cookie with enough sugar to cover the entire cookie.", "Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned around the edges, 10 to 12 minutes.", "Have all ingredients at room temperature (except milk and egg, of course).", "Muz's recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of milk, but after the first go-around the dough seemed a little dry. So, I added a third tablespoon of milk and it turned out really well. So I recommend 3 instead of 3.", "I added another 1/2 teaspoon vanilla for more flavor, so do what you want with it.", "Her recipe also called for just 1 cup of white sugar, but after following the recipe the first time, they just weren't as sweet as I remembered. So when I made them the second time, I added another 1/2 cup, which turned out perfectly. Again, do what you want."], "nutrition facts": "63 calories; protein 0.6g; carbohydrates 8.4g; fat 3.1g; cholesterol 6.6mg; sodium 47.2mg"}
