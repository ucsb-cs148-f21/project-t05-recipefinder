Usually Gruyere cheese is used but I had some very sharp farmhouse Cheddar cheese in the fridge, so I decided to use that. As long as you are using a very sharp, full-flavored cheese I don't think you can go wrong. I love gougeres with Gruyere, but I think the extra-sharp Cheddar was just as good.", "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.", "Stir water, butter, and salt together in a pot; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium and whisk flour into butter mixture until a paste-like dough forms, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer dough to a bowl to cool until warm, 5 to 10 minutes.", "Whisk 1 egg, thyme, and black pepper into cooled dough until egg is completely incorporated. Add remaining egg and whisk until completely incorporated into dough. Stir 3/4 the cheese into dough until combined. Scoop 1-inch balls of dough onto prepared baking sheet. Top each with remaining cheese.", "Bake in the preheated oven until golden and puffed, 15 to 20 minutes."], "nutrition facts": "84 calories; protein 2.8g; carbohydrates 4.2g; fat 6.3g; cholesterol 46.1mg; sodium 81.5mg"}
