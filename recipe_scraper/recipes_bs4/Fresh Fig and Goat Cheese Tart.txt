But instead of using standard pie crust dough, I decided to try something a little more rustic and savory, using spelt flour and olive oil. I knew this would pair beautifully with the sweet fruit and tangy cheese, but it ended up being way too crumbly. So, I just crumbled it into the bottom of a shallow ramekin and the rest is history.", "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).", "Mix spelt flour, olive oil, salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, with a fork. Starting with 3 tablespoons water, drizzle in just enough for dough to come together. Turn out dough onto work surface. Knead dough until it comes together. Crumble dough and press pieces into the bottoms of 4 small tart pans to form a 1/4-inch-thick bottom crust.", "Crumble 2 ounces goat cheese onto each crust.
