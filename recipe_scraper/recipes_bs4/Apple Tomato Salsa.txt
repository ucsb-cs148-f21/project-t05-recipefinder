I don't like spicy salsas so it's more flavorful than hot, but you can spice it up however you want. I used 'on-the-vine' tomatoes because of their juiciness. I toasted my own tortilla chips in the oven for 3 minutes on each side then cut them size. I didn't want the oil and salt from store bought chips, but try whatever kind of chips you want.", "Cook and stir garlic in a skillet over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir tomatoes, apples, and jicama into garlic; cook and stir until tomatoes are hot, 3 to 5 minutes.", "Stir cilantro, chives, basil, and salt into tomato mixture; drizzle lime juice and vinegar over the top.
