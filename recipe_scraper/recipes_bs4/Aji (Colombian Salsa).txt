Goes great with grilled meats, empanadas, and tostones, but I put it on everything... even my eggs! There seem to be several variations of this; some watery, some oily, some saucy, some chunky, but my mom is from Barranquilla, Colombia and this is how she makes it.", "Combine tomato, cilantro, onion, jalapeno pepper, and garlic in a food processor. Add olive oil, lime juice, sugar, apple cider vinegar, and salt; pulse until a coarse paste forms. Mix in green onions.", "Substitute 1 teaspoon garlic paste for the garlic cloves if preferred.", "Please note that this salsa can turn out great with more or with no jalapeno; it just depends on your preference. However, because the spiciness of jalapenos is very unpredictable, I highly recommend leaving it out, transferring the salsa to a bowl, and then adding the finely chopped jalapeno gradually. I even throw mine in a small Magic Bullet(R)-style blender with a little olive oil and turn it into a paste so I can add it very carefully. This also allows you to separate the salsa into mild and spicy batches."], "nutrition facts": "52 calories; protein 0.8g; carbohydrates 5g; fat 3.5g; sodium 299.3mg"}
