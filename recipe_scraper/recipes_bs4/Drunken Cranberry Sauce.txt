We love it as a side dish to our turkey on Thanksgiving day. Also goes well on chicken, pork, and beef. Makes a great treat as an appetizer served with crackers, or can even be used over vanilla ice cream. I like to add the orange zest a couple tablespoons at a time, as not to overdo it. Adjust sweetness by adding 1 tablespoon sugar at a time at the end of cooking if needed.", "Heat a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir sugar, orange juice, half the cranberries, and tequila in the warmed saucepan until mixture is slightly reduced, about 20 minutes.
