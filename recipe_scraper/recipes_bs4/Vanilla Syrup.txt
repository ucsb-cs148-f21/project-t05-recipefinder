Split vanilla bean lengthwise on a work surface; scrape out seeds with the back of a knife. Add seeds and pod to saucepan; boil until syrup is thickened slightly, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.", "Cook's Notes:", "A thicker syrup can be made by reducing sugar amount to 1 cup. The thicker syrup is more for iced coffee. The thin syrup makes great vanilla soda with 1/4 part syrup and 3/4 part soda water. The thin syrup plus sweetened condensed milk on shaved ice makes a great snow cone.", "Store in the refrigerator until ready to use. I use clean Ball(R) jars for storage.", "Syrup can be stored with or without the vanilla bean, but don't eat it."], "nutrition facts": "78 calories; carbohydrates 20.2g; sodium 0.7mg"}
