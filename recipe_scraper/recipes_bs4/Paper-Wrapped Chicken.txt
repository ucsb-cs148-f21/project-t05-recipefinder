I've also added in very thinly sliced onion and green peppers to the marinade and it was really good.", "Mix the teriyaki sauce, garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes in a bowl; stir in the chicken pieces until thoroughly coated.", "Cover the bowl and refrigerate the chicken 3 to 4 hours to overnight.", "Remove a piece of chicken from the marinade and place into the center of an aluminum square.", "Fold the square diagonally over the chicken piece in a triangle shape; fold up the open edges of the triangle several times and press tightly together to seal the chicken into the foil.
