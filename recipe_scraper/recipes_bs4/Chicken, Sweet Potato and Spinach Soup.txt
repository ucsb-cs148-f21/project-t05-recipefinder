It was mild but I love it even when I'm not under the weather. She would use her own roasted chickens, but when I'm not feeling well I don't feel like roasting my own chicken, and the store-bought ones work in a pinch. Serve with crusty bread.", "Heat chicken stock and sweet potato in a stockpot over high heat. Cook until sweet potato is soft enough to pierce with a fork, about 10 minutes. Stir in spinach, chicken, and garlic; simmer until spinach is wilted and broth is reduced slightly, 10 to 15 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper."], "nutrition facts": "84 calories; protein 7.1g; carbohydrates 6g; fat 3.6g; cholesterol 18.9mg; sodium 686.7mg"}
