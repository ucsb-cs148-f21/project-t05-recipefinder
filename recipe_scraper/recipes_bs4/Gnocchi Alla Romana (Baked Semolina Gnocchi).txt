In this recipe, pancetta is added to the mix for a tastier version of this classical Roman dish.", "Combine milk, 1/4 cup butter, and a pinch of salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Whisk semolina into boiling milk, mixing well to prevent lumps. Reduce heat and cook, stirring often, until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Add egg yolks, 1 cup Grana Padano, and Gruyere cheese; stir well.", "Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pancetta until crisp, 7 to 10 minutes.
