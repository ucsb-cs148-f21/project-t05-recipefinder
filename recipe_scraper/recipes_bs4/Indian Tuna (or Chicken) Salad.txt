I was in the mood to make tuna salad but wanted something different, and when I didn't find a recipe that interested me, I made one up based on bhel puri chaat. The chutneys called for might not be standard issue in your pantry, but the store-bought ones do keep a long time and add a lot of flavor with no fat. The key to this recipe is the balance of flavors and textures. You need sweet and spicy, crunchy and soft. It's delicious and of course, it was easy. Serve on toasted naan, in sandwich wraps, tortillas, open-faced on toasted bread, or over greens as a salad.", "Mix tuna, celery, red onion, raisins, carrot, and walnuts together in a bowl. Add mayonnaise, tamarind chutney, red chile chutney, green chutney, garam masala, and salt; mix with a fork until uniform in consistency.", "Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.", "Adjust the flavors as desired by adding more or less of the wet ingredients. More mayo and less chutney would make it milder, more red chile chutney would make it hotter. The chutneys are what make it, try them in different proportions.", "It would be more authentically Indian with green mango instead of raisins, and you could use peppers instead of onions."], "nutrition facts": "470 calories; protein 20.5g; carbohydrates 41.8g; fat 26.9g; cholesterol 26.7mg; sodium 492.2mg"}
