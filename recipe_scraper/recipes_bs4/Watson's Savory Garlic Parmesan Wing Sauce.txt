It actually turned out to be a great sauce with awesome flavor and coats the wings perfectly. Everyone loved it so I had to share it and even made pizza with it using it instead of pizza sauce and it was great. It's great on other things too, so experiment and let me know what you come up with.", "Pour enough olive oil into a skillet to cover the bottom; turn heat to high. Saute garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add lime juice and cook for 45 seconds. Stir cream into garlic mixture; cook until mixture is slightly reduced, about 1 minute.", "Mix Greek seasoning, black pepper, and cayenne pepper into cream mixture. Add Parmesan cheese and stir until melted and sauce is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.", "Greek seasoning is really salty, so if you add more don't add too much.", "For less-thick sauce, just add more cream and vice versa.", "This makes a great base sauce for a pizza or if you're too in love with traditional marinara sauce you could also use it to really spice up the crust. It is great stuffing for chicken too."], "nutrition facts": "85 calories; protein 2.5g; carbohydrates 2.1g; fat 7.6g; cholesterol 24.8mg; sodium 142mg"}
