The flavorful wild rice, kale, and veggie combination with a lemony dressing can be made year-round and earns raves whenever it's served. It also keeps wonderfully, so make it ahead with no hesitation.", "Whisk 1/2 cup lemon juice, olive oil, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until dressing is smooth.", "Bring water, wild rice, and butter to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Drain excess liquid and cook uncovered until water is completely evaporated, about 5 minutes more. Stir rice and let cool slightly.", "Combine cabbage, red bell peppers, and fennel in the bowl with dressing; toss to evenly coat. Place kale on top of the cabbage mixture and spoon warm wild rice over kale; let sit until kale is slightly wilted, 5 to 10 minutes. Toss until salad is evenly mixed, adding more lemon juice to taste.", "Two to three lemons will yield 1/2 cup lemon juice.", "If desired, crumbled blue cheese, toasted and chopped hazelnuts, and/or sliced radishes may be added to the salad."], "nutrition facts": "211 calories; protein 7.6g; carbohydrates 35.2g; fat 6g; cholesterol 0.9mg; sodium 102.6mg"}
