I came up with this recipe after being presented with two gigantic bags of Meyer lemons...Thanks, Sharon. Spooned into some decorative jelly jars, it made for some very welcome holiday and host gifts. My secret to prevent curdling is to start out the cooking low and slow; when it smooths out, then turn the heat up to medium and stir constantly until it's done.", "Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in eggs and yolks one at a time until incorporated. Mix in lemon juice. Transfer mixture to a saucepan.", "Cook the mixture over low heat, stirring gently until smooth. Increase the heat to medium and simmer gently, stirring constantly, until curd is thick enough to coat a spoon and reaches 170 degrees F (77 degrees C) on a candy thermometer, 15 to 30 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon zest.", "Transfer curd to a bowl and press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent a skin forming as it cools. Allow to cool briefly, about 10 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill until thick.", "Mixture will appear curdled in step 1 but will come together when cooked. Do not let it come to a boil. If it does overcook and curdles, pour curd through a fine-mesh sieve when done cooking to strain out the curdled parts.", "If you like, this can also be made with lime, grapefruit, or your favorite citrus instead of lemon.", "If you aren't planning on using it right away, transfer to clean jars or a tightly covered container. Covered tightly, it will keep in the refrigerator for about a week and in the freezer for up to 2 months."], "nutrition facts": "209 calories; protein 2.4g; carbohydrates 27g; fat 11g; cholesterol 120.6mg; sodium 81mg"}
