Great recipe to finish up corned beef and potato leftovers! It's hearty and savory with a zesty sweet tang to it. Normally served for parties but can be served as a side dish for lunch or appetizer. Serve with fresh white or brown bread rolls.", "Combine 3/4 cup mayonnaise, ketchup, warm water, and vinegar in a large bowl and mix well. Stir in chopped gherkins, cocktail onions, diced apple, and shredded carrot. Add corned beef, mashed potatoes, and salt and pepper to taste; mix well.", "Form the potato salad on a plate as a loaf or a round mound. Garnish with slices of cucumber, halved cherry tomatoes, and slices of egg. Decorate with swirls or wavy lines of mayonnaise to add a little flair (see Cook's Note). Chill for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend.", "If you don't have deli-sliced corned beef, you can use canned corned beef. The older, more traditional recipe doesn't include apples and carrots, but nowadays you can even add capers. Use mayonnaise from a squeeze tube to garnish the salad, if desired."], "nutrition facts": "409 calories; protein 11.6g; carbohydrates 22.4g; fat 31.2g; cholesterol 172.1mg; sodium 830.8mg"}
