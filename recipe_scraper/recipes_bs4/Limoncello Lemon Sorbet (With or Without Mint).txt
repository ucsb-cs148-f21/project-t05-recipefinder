Let syrup cool slightly, about 10 minutes.", "Mix remaining 1 1/2 cup water, lemon juice, and limoncello liqueur into syrup.", "Pour mixture into an ice cream maker; churn according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 15 minutes. Freeze until firm, about 6 hours.", "Cook's Notes:", "If you don't have an ice cream maker: Pour mixture into a small shallow dish and place in the freezer. Stir every 30 to 45 minutes in the first 2 to 3 hours to break up ice chunks; keep frozen until smooth and firm, 4 to 5 hours more.", "You can add more water or limoncello to taste. Please note that changing the liqueur-to-water ratio will alter the freezing properties.

If using more liqueur, be wary of adding too much as the mixture won't freeze."], "nutrition facts": "163 calories; protein 0.2g; carbohydrates 39.9g; sodium 3.8mg"}
