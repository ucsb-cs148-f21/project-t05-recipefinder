The recipe is the basic stock recipe my great grandma used and her mother before her. Once you have a basic stock you can add leftovers, use it to cook rice, make a soup with dumplings, the uses are endless. Hot stock with a few veggies and alphabet pasta is great after school warm-up. I have soup made in the fridge so hubby can snack on it instead of junk.", "Combine turkey carcass, onions, carrots, celery, green bell pepper, garlic, chicken bouillon cubes, peppercorns, and bay leaves in a stockpot; pour in enough water to cover. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until flavors blend, about 1 hour. Remove stockpot from heat and let sit for 15 minutes. Strain stock through a cheese cloth and discard solids.", "I keep ends of root veggies, tops of the peppers, and use them for the meat stock when I make soup from the Sunday roast. Leaving the skin on the onion will darken the stock and add more taste. I use roasted peppers and whole roasted garlic."], "nutrition facts": "63 calories; protein 2.1g; carbohydrates 11.7g; fat 1.2g; cholesterol 2.7mg; sodium 452.8mg"}
