{"name": "Simple Savory Oatmeal", "prep": "5 mins", "cook": "5 mins", "total": "10 mins", "servings": "1", "yield": "1 cup", "ingredients": ["1 cup water", "\u00bd cup rolled oats", "1 tablespoon cooked real bacon bits", "1 teaspoon butter", "\u00bd teaspoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Cachere's\u00ae)"], "steps": ["Want something savory in the morning, but needs to be quick and simple? This is it. I'd compare it most readily to a deluxe cheese grits recipe, but this has no cheese--and grits (unless instant) are typically a bunch more work. This was an alternative for my 10-year-old who always wanted eggs and sausage for breakfast. Fruits and brown sugar in the oatmeal wasn't cutting it.", "Place water and oats in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook at 50% power, stirring half way through cooking, until oats are softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in butter until melted. Stir in bacon bits and Creole seasoning until evenly distributed.", "There are many ways to go with this dish. Keeping it savory, I would keep a small amount of a fat and salt and pepper seasonings. You can substitute olive oil, bacon or sausage drippings, fish oil, or flavored oils for the butter; substitute spice-seasoned salt, garlic or onion salt, or a small amount of dry bouillon for the salt and pepper; use fake bacon bits, scrambled egg, tuna, ground sausage, or cubed ham in place of the bacon.", "Add green onion, minced garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, or dried green herbs such as an Italian blend, if desired.", "Cook oats according to your preference. I find cooking in the microwave for twice the recommended duration at half-power works well and avoids spill-over.", "This recipe is inspired by a savory oatmeal (with egg) included in the recent free SNAP cookbook, available online as a PDF."], "nutrition facts": "218 calories; protein 8.5g; carbohydrates 28g; fat 8.3g; cholesterol 15.8mg; sodium 495.3mg"}
