This is a world-famous, award-winning recipe given to my father by the barman at a deluxe hotel, who would knock this up on demand in record time. And boy, was it in demand! Chop the beef by hand, as machines tend to crush the meat and you end up with a soggy mess. My father's award-winning barman friend (sadly, now no longer with us) actually used 2 knives simultaneously in each hand to do this. He prepared the whole thing, including chopping the meat, in 15 minutes. If he knew he was going to be busy, then he pre-cut and sliced and diced everything beforehand, in which case he served it in less than 5 minutes. Serve with thin, buttered toast.", "Put olive oil in a serving bowl. Add ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, hot pepper sauce, curry powder, curry powder, salt, and ground pepper. Mix thoroughly.", "Crush anchovy fillets on a plate using 2 forks until they are finely separated. Add onion, gherkin, and capers; stir together before scraping into the bowl with the ketchup mixture. Add chopped beef; mix thoroughly. Stir in egg yolks and beer."], "nutrition facts": "298 calories; protein 16g; carbohydrates 6.8g; fat 22.2g; cholesterol 158.7mg; sodium 526.2mg"}
