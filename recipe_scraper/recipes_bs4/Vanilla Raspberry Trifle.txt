Its very simple to make and yummy. I have made a few changes to it due in large to a lack of birds custard mix.", "Line the bottom of a deep glass dish with 1/2 the ladyfingers. Pour 1/2 the rum over ladyfingers; top with 1/2 the raspberries.", "Beat cold milk, pudding mix, and orange zest together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth, about 2 minutes. Spoon 1/2 the pudding over raspberry layer. Arrange the remaining lady fingers atop pudding layer and around sides of bowl. Pour remaining rum over ladyfingers; top with remaining raspberries and pudding. Refrigerate trifle for flavors to set, about 1 hour.", "Beat heavy cream in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium-low speed until fluffy. Spoon whipped cream over trifle and sprinkle with almonds.", "Keep in mind the liquor is optional for a more child-friendly dessert. Strawberries work just as well in place of raspberries. As far as bowls go, we use two types. I have one that is tall to help with the layering. But we have on many occasions just used a wide glass bowl that's only about 3-inches deep and just done one layer."], "nutrition facts": "426 calories; protein 7.6g; carbohydrates 39.1g; fat 24.6g; cholesterol 110.1mg; sodium 366.1mg"}
