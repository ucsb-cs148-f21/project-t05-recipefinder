There are several recipes that replicate this flavor out there, but this is different in that there is no icing and lends itself to being taken to the pub easier.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).", "Grease a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as a Bundt\u00ae) and coat inside of pan with unsweetened cocoa powder.", "Beat cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, 1 egg, and Irish cream liqueur in a bowl until smooth and creamy.

I have also made cupcakes out of this in the same manner."], "nutrition facts": "449 calories; protein 5.8g; carbohydrates 47.8g; fat 24.5g; cholesterol 81.1mg; sodium 475.2mg"}
