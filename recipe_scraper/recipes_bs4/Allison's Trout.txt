Thrilling. This recipe is my recreation of a dish that was made by a man named Botsy, years ago, in the Rocky Mountains. It's delicious and enhances fresh trout without overpowering it. These could also be prepared in foil packets on a camping trip over an open fire. Although we camp, I don't often include a bottle of sherry in my kitchen box. When you add the sherry, pour a glass for yourself.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a shallow baking dish with foil.", "Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; pour in lemon juice. Cook and stir mushrooms until tender, about 5 minutes; stir in sherry. Place trout fillets with skin sides down into prepared baking dish; sprinkle with salt and cracked pepper.
