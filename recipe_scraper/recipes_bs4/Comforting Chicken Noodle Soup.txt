Great for warm days, sick days, or just any day. I sometimes serve this with mashed potatoes as well! The more flour on the pasta from rolling it out, the thicker your soup will be.", "Pour 10 cups of water into a large soup pot over high heat with the leek, halved carrot, 3-inch piece of ginger, and peppercorns.", "Bring to a boil, turn heat to medium-low, and place chicken breasts into the broth", "Cover the pot with a lid and simmer the mixture until the chicken is cooked through and tender, 20 to 30 minutes.", "While broth is simmering, whisk flour and salt together in a bowl; beat in the eggs, butter, and enough milk to make a stiff but workable dough.", "Knead the dough in the bowl until smooth and slightly springy, about 5 minutes; transfer to a bowl, cover with a cloth, and allow to rest for 10 minutes.", "Roll the noodle dough out on a floured surface to desired thickness (1/4- to 1/8-inch thick); cut into strips.", "Remove chicken breasts, transfer them to a plate, and allow to cool.
