Add onions, chile peppers, macadamia nuts, garlic, ginger, galangal, and turmeric; blend into a smooth paste, thinning slightly with water if needed.", "Place beef in a 12-inch skillet or wok. Mix in paste and coat beef thoroughly. Add coconut milk, lemongrass knots, cinnamon, lime leaves, cardamom, and star anise to form a sauce.", "Bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered, stirring with a spatula every 15 minutes, until sauce has reduced and thickened, about 1 hour.
