However, it all comes at a cost. The classic procedure is a little bothersome, since you need to make three separate components \u2013 a zabaione, a meringue, and whipped cream \u2013 so, I decided to simply use the eggs whole, and make a 'zabaringue.' I knew I wouldn't get as much volume, but I didn't care.", "Whisk eggs, sugar, coffee-flavored liqueur, instant coffee, and 1 teaspoon cocoa powder together in a metal bowl.", "Place bowl over low heat on the stove (holding bowl with a dishtowel) and continue whisking until mixture thickens, 4 to 6 minutes. Whisk continually to prevent eggs from scrambling. Remove bowl from heat and let mixture cool completely. (You can set the bowl on ice water to speed this up.)", "Whisk ice-cold heavy cream and sugar together in a chilled bowl until stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cooled egg-coffee mixture to the whipped cream. Stir with a spatula until just combined.", "Transfer mixture to serving cups.

Garnish with whipped cream and a dusting of cocoa powder.", "Answering questions about how to use this technique to make other flavors is tough, since there are many variables. Theoretically, if you replace the coffee and liquor, with other similar \"stuff,\" then you should get a similar product. Good luck!"], "nutrition facts": "279 calories; protein 7.3g; carbohydrates 24.4g; fat 16.3g; cholesterol 227.1mg; sodium 83mg"}
