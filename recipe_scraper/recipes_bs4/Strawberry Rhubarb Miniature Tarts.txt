It is easily converted to a vegan dessert by omitting the egg white for 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in the fruit filling, and substituting butter with margarine in the crust. Add a dollop of whipped topping and enjoy! It's hard to eat just one :) Feel free to customize the amount of pretzel versus nut mixture. I do not always do it exactly, but either way it produces a savory, sweet, crunchy crust that is delicious. serve warm with whipped cream, whipped topping, gelato, or ice cream (either traditional vanilla or a non-dairy variety of ice cream tastes great).", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
