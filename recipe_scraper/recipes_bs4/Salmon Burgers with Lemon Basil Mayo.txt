These salmon burgers were the perfect solution for us! Serve on hamburger buns with preferred garnish (lettuce, tomato, onion, etc.)", "Combine salmon, onion, bread crumbs, green bell pepper, 3 cloves garlic, egg, soy sauce, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, and salt in a large bowl; mix until evenly blended. Shape salmon mixture into eight patties.", "Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook salmon patties until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes per side.", "Whisk mayonnaise, 2 cloves garlic, basil, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and lemon pepper in a bowl until well mixed. Serve mayonnaise mixture with salmon patties.", "Since there are only 3 of us - I usually make these and freeze half of the mixture to thaw and serve later. I've also used tartar sauce instead of mayo. If you would prefer to use a grill - I would recommend placing a sheet of aluminum foil over the grate and spraying with cooking spray so the fish doesn't stick and the patties don't fall apart."], "nutrition facts": "427 calories; protein 22.2g; carbohydrates 10.6g; fat 33.8g; cholesterol 89.5mg; sodium 572.3mg"}
