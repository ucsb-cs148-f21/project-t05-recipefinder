So I replaced some of the flour with coconut and almond flour and used 1/2 cup of coconut oil instead of a whole cup of butter. I use all organic ingredients, but that's up to you. This is our family go-to cookie recipe. We've made it so many different ways and loved them all, but our favorites are semisweet chocolate chips with walnuts, or white chocolate chips with macadamia nuts. It's a win-win with these amazing cookies.", "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
