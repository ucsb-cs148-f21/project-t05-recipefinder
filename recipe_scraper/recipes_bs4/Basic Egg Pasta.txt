This dough can be mixed by hand or with a stand mixer. Like any flour recipe, the amount of flour required isn't a given. It will change depending on the size of your eggs and the humidity of your region.", "Pile flour onto a work surface and make a small well in the center; place eggs, egg yolks, olive oil, and salt into the well. Gently stir the egg mixture with a fork, gradually drawing in flour until dough comes together.", "Knead dough with hands until smooth and leathery, about 10 minutes.", "Wrap dough in plastic wrap; let rest until malleable, 1 to 2 hours. Remove plastic wrap.", "Cut dough into four pieces; roll out with a rolling pin. Run flattened pieces through a pasta roller to create desired noodle shape.", "Based on the commercial flours available in my region, all-purpose flour will work too, but the resulting noodle won't be quite as supple.", "Add up to 2 more egg yolks if dough does not clump together in step 1. The dough needs to be a little drier when you're extruding it and a little more moist if you're going to roll it."], "nutrition facts": "73 calories; protein 4.5g; carbohydrates 0.5g; fat 5.9g; cholesterol 195.4mg; sodium 77.8mg"}
