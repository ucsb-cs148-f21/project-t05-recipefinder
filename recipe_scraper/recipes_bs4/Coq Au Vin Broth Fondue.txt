I've been trying to make it at home ever since. This is the closest I've come and it's always a big hit! Enjoy for a romantic dinner for 2 at home or prepare a larger quantity for a dinner party. Either way, we rarely have leftovers! Dip chicken, steak, veggies, etc.", "Heat vegetable stock in a saucepan over medium heat or a fondue pot until simmering; add red wine, mushrooms, green onions, and garlic. Simmer until broth is aromatic, about 15 minutes.", "If you're using an electric fondue pot, heat the vegetable stock on medium in Step 1. If you're using a fondue pot that requires a Sterno(R) fuel source, partially cover the sterno can so that the fondue doesn't get too hot too quickly.", "While your fondue is simmering, prepare your dippers. Cut vegetables, potatoes, meats, and any other dippers into bite-size pieces.", "Place your dippers in the fondue pot using skewers. If you use shrimp or other seafood, it will cook quite rapidly (i.e. 1 to 2 minutes) whereas chicken and steak will take a little longer. We like to just put the vegetables into the broth and fish them out when they're tender."], "nutrition facts": "115 calories; protein 2.8g; carbohydrates 12.9g; fat 1g; sodium 811.1mg"}
