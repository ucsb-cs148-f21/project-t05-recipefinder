If you do not have a sourdough starter, substitute sour milk or buttermilk. I also changed the bacon drippings to applesauce to make this healthier. These come out of the waffle iron looking amazing - crispy on the outside and tangy and tender on the inside, and they smell like baking bread while cooking. Eat with lots of syrup if you prefer a sweeter waffle, as there is very little sweetener in this recipe.", "Grease and preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.", "Mix sourdough starter and eggs in a bowl. Mix in flour, baking soda, salt, and sugar. Stir applesauce into the batter; mix well to combine.", "Pour 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the batter onto the preheated waffle iron.
