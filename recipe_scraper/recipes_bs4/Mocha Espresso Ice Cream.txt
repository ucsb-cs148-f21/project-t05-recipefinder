Best after a steak or beef dinner.", "Mix heavy cream, whole milk, sugar, espresso, and chocolate syrup in a bowl until sugar is dissolved. Refrigerate until chilled.", "Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches \"soft-serve\" consistency. Stir in almonds and dark chocolate. Serve soft ice cream or transfer ice cream to a one- or two-quart lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight.", "If possible, do not add the nut and chocolate mixture until the end of the ice-cream process as it becomes thicker. This allows the solids to mix throughout the ice-cream without collecting in the bottom. Otherwise, you may save them as a topping when you're ready to serve. If you prefer a strong espresso flavor, reduce milk to 1-1/4 cups and add in one more shot of espresso. This is a good dessert if you're having a beef tenderloin or steak main course!"], "nutrition facts": "317 calories; protein 4.3g; carbohydrates 27g; fat 22.8g; cholesterol 57.4mg; sodium 35.7mg"}
