The first time she made sancocho I fell in love with it. It is often made with 7 different meats for a special festivity or holiday. I have simplified the meats in my version, but don't be afraid to use many kinds; this is my mimicked recipe. Great by itself or served the traditional way over rice. Super filling and even better the next day.", "Mash garlic, oregano, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a bowl.", "Douse chicken, beef, and pork with lemon juice in a large bowl. Drain half the liquid. Mix the mashed garlic, half of the onions, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, and vinegar into the meat mixture.", "Heat the remaining 1/2 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meat mixture in batches and cook until browned on all sides, 15 to 20 minutes.", "Transfer the browned meats into a large pot. Add half of the water, chicken broth, beef consomme, 2 bouillon cubes, and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until meats are more than halfway cooked through, about 40 minutes.", "Combine pumpkin, sweet potatoes, eddeos, yuca, potatoes, plantains, corn, celery, carrots, green pepper, cilantro, and adobo seasoning in the simmering pot.
