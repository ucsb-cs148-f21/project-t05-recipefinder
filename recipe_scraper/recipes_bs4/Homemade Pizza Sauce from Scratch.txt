I wanted to do it from scratch! So I experimented until I got it right. This is much better than the store-bought sauce with none of those nasty preservatives.", "Place tomatoes, water, and olive oil in a blender or food processor; blend until smooth. Transfer tomato mixture to a large pot.", "Stir sugar, garlic salt, and vinegar into tomato mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, 1 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.", "Pour tomato sauce into a clean blender or food processor no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until tomato sauce is very smooth.", "This should yield enough for about 8 12-inch pizzas where you need about 6 tablespoons sauce per pizza. You can put what you don't use in plastic bags in the freezer. I put 6 tablespoons sauce into 8 separate bags. Just run hot water over the bag to thaw."], "nutrition facts": "35 calories; protein 0.4g; carbohydrates 4.9g; fat 1.8g; sodium 682mg"}
