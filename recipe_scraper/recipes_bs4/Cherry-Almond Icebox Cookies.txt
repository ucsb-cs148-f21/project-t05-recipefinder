Stir flour into butter mixture until crumbly; stir in almonds and cherries. Press mixture evenly into the bottom of prepared pan.", "Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden at edges, about 20 minutes.

Lift cookies from pan and slice to separate along scored marks.", "Melt white chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave).
