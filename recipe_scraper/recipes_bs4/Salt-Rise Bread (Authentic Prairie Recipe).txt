It is a very easy recipe, but it does take a little extra time for the rising. So if you are in a hurry, this is not the recipe for you. It has a taste like sourdough and is a favorite in my family. Perfect for sandwiches!", "Combine potatoes, cornmeal, 1 teaspoon salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Pour boiling water on top. Cover with a dish towel; let sit for 24 hours in a warm place.", "Remove potatoes from the yeast water, and add milk, 1 cup water, butter, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and baking soda to the bowl. Add 1 cup flour at a time, stirring constantly, until dough begins to come together and pull away from the sides of the bowl.", "Turn dough out onto a floured surface; cut into 3 equal pieces. Knead each piece until soft and elastic. Place dough in 3 well-buttered bread pans and turn to coat. Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 24 hours.", "Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).", "Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, about 45 minutes.", "Make sure you peel the potatoes or the yeast will not become active.", "If you are wondering if the loaves are done, carefully tip one out of the pan onto the counter and gently tap the bottom. If it sounds hollow, bread is done."], "nutrition facts": "202 calories; protein 5.8g; carbohydrates 40.3g; fat 1.6g; cholesterol 3.3mg; sodium 108mg"}
