I recommend you double the recipe because my husband eats them two at a time. Serve the smothered pork chops over cooked rice with your favorite vegetable side dish and cornbread.", "Mix seasoned salt, garlic powder, black pepper, and paprika together in a bowl; rub about 3/4 teaspoon spice mixture onto each pork chop. Thoroughly coat each pork chop with flour, saving remaining seasoning and flour for the gravy.", "Heat vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat; cook pork chops in the hot oil until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer pork chops to a plate, retaining drippings in the pan. Cover pork chops with paper towels.", "Cook and stir onion in the drippings in the heavy skillet over medium heat until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add mushrooms, remaining flour, remaining spice mixture, and about 1 teaspoon water if needed to moisten; cook and stir until onion is golden brown, about 5 minutes.", "Stir 2 cups water into onion-mushroom mixture until gravy is smooth; bring to a boil.
