This gluten-free version is adapted from the recipe passed down for generation in my family. One great thing about this recipe is that it can work around almost any schedule during busy holiday cooking. Make the bread crumbs anytime the week before. Broth and bread mixture can sit up to 4 hours and then throw it in the oven with any other dish you are baking. I have tossed it in ovens ranging between 300 degrees F (149 degrees C) to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C).
