My husband often brews kombucha at home and to have it in a hot toddy is amazing! This is the first kombucha toddy recipe ever made. I invented this and tweaked it. I'm sure it's a good starter for more variations of hot toddies. Enjoy!", "Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add orange juice and brown sugar; stir until sugar dissolves, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in kombucha, cinnamon sticks, and cloves. Simmer gently until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Stir in brandy and pour into mugs.", "Everyone's kombucha is different. Apple-flavored works best for this recipe. I like a mild sweet brew so adjust brown sugar to taste. Substitute honey for the brown sugar if desired. Same for the alcohol. My husband loves brandy, but you can use dark rum or bourbon."], "nutrition facts": "80 calories; protein 0.3g; carbohydrates 7.6g; fat 0.6g; cholesterol 1.3mg; sodium 10mg"}
