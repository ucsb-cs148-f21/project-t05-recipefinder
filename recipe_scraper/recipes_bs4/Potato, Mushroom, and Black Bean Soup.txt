Stir onion, garlic, basil, chives, orange zest, and lemon zest into the tomatoes; cook at a simmer until slightly frothy, 7 to 10 minutes.", "Stir potatoes, mushrooms, black beans, and salt into the tomato mixture; continue simmering until the potatoes are tender, at least 30 minutes.", "You can leave the tomatoes semi-chunky if you prefer them that way for texture.", "For a more southwestern flair, replace basil and chives with fresh cilantro, replace orange and lemon zest with lime zest, and add some green chiles, jalapeno peppers, or whatever other hot chile pepper you like."], "nutrition facts": "121 calories; protein 5.8g; carbohydrates 24.8g; fat 0.5g; sodium 768.7mg"}
