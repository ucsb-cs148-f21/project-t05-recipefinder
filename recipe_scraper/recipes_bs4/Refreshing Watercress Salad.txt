This salad is definitely different but delicious. I highly recommend using cherry or grape tomatoes since they have a firm texture. The peanuts should be crushed and not left whole and don't leave out or substitute the ingredients if possible. The flavors are very strong due to the lime and fish sauce, so be prepared. The watercress does not have to be chopped up.", "Place watercress in a large bowl; top with tomatoes, onion, peanuts, lime juice, sesame seeds, garlic oil, fish sauce, and salt. Toss mixture well; let sit for flavors to blend, about 10 minutes.", "If watercress is too long, cut into 2-inch pieces. Sometimes I place it in a bowl and run my scissors through it a couple of times.", "Taste and add more salt, lime juice, and fish sauce if necessary. Before serving, toss well as the tomatoes and peanuts will fall to the bottom."], "nutrition facts": "144 calories; protein 7.8g; carbohydrates 11.7g; fat 9.5g; sodium 648.2mg"}
