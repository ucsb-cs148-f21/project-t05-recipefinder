{"name": "Fat Sam's Meaty Melted Man Dip - Is It Football Season, Yet???", "prep": "5 mins", "cook": "20 mins", "total": "25 mins", "servings": "10", "yield": "10 servings", "ingredients": ["1 pound pork breakfast sausage", "2 (1.25 ounce) packages taco seasoning mix, divided", "3 cups water, divided", "2 pounds processed cheese food, cubed", "1 tablespoon Louisiana-style hot sauce"], "steps": ["A quick, spicy sausage cheese dip. This isn't tea party food, nothing dainty or low-fat about it. This is an appetizer that eats like a MEAL and it keeps guests coming back to the bowl. You may have to work out twice to make up for it, but you'll be happy you did! Best served hot with plenty of tortilla chips.", "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain in a colander and discard grease. Transfer sausage to a large saucepan.", "Gradually add cheese food, stirring until cheese is evenly melted, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix hot sauce into melted cheese mixture. If the mixture becomes too thick, add remaining 1 cup water, as needed.", "Add as much or as little hot sauce as you like, but keep in mind: the longer you cook the dip, the more heat you will get from the cayenne pepper in the hot sauce.", "Be careful with continuing heat, as the cheese will burn if left on the heat without stirring. If you don't have a small serving slow cooker, try keeping the dip in a large size slow cooker and serving up a bowl at a time next to the chips.", "This keeps great in the fridge for up to a week, if it lasts that long. To reheat, spoon the desired amount into a bowl, add a teaspoon or two of water, and microwave on medium for 1 to 2 minutes until hot."], "nutrition facts": "439 calories; protein 22.9g; carbohydrates 12.3g; fat 32.6g; cholesterol 98.6mg; sodium 2110.2mg"}
