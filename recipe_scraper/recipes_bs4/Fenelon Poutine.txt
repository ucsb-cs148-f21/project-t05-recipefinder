People say real poutine must have mozzarella cheese curds - I emphatically disagree! In every restaurant I've been to in Ontario, they use shredded cheese. If you're like me and prefer the English-Canadian version (non-cheese curds) and want to try something different, try this!", "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry potatoes in batches in the hot oil until tender and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove to drain on a plate lined with paper towels.", "Heat gravy in a small saucepan over medium heat until heated through, about 5 minutes.", "Spread a layer of fries into two bowls, sprinkle with cheese and add a small amount of gravy; repeat these layers once. Squirt each serving with 1 tablespoon mayonnaise and 1 1/2 teaspoons ketchup. Sprinkle each bowl with half the lettuce; season with salt and pepper.", "Of course you can just make it with the fries, cheese and gravy, but anyone could figure that out! This is what my friends and I used to call Big Mac poutine! Prep time really just depends on whether you make the ingredients or buy them from the store. I prefer frozen fries for this mixture and fresh gravy is always better.", "We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking.
