I was so happy with how it tasted that I decided to make this my first recipe submission. This makes a very light sauce. If you prefer a heartier sauce, add 1/2 can of tomato paste or even use crushed tomatoes instead of whole, but I encourage you to try it as written; it's so yummy! Serve over al-dente spaghetti noodles. I hope you enjoy!", "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chicken and onion together in the hot oil until the chicken is completely browned and the onions tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir garlic, basil, kosher salt, and black pepper into the chicken mixture; cook for 1 minute.", "Blend the tomatoes in a blender until smooth; pour over the chicken mixture and bring to a simmer.
