On my one of my recent visits, they had avocado curry. I had never thought of mixing a decadent coconut curry with a delicious avocado. After all, delicious fat plus more delicious fat is always a win. So I ordered it, made mental notes along the way and whipped up a batch the very next day.

Serve over rice or noodles.", "Blend coconut milk, 1/2 avocado, 1/2 cup water, seasoning sauce, curry paste, and lime juice in a blender until smooth, adding more water if curry is too thick. Pour curry into a large saucepan and bring to a boil.", "Stir green beans, tempeh, and carrot into curry; reduce heat to medium.
