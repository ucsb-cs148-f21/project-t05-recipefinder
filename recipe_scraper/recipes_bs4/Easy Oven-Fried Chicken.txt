My family loves this and it's simply a matter of changing the seasonings to get an entirely new flavour.", "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).", "Melt shortening and butter in a 9x13-inch baking dish in the preheating oven. Once melted, pour enough vegetable oil into the baking dish until oil is about 1/2-inch deep. Keep oil mixture in the oven while preparing remaining ingredients.", "Beat egg and water in a shallow dish. Combine crackers, cornmeal, sage, tarragon, and garlic powder in a large resealable plastic bag. Season with salt and pepper; seal and shake bag to mix.

Arrange chicken thighs skin-side down, in preheated baking dish.", "Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
