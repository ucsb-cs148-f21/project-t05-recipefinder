This version was conceived in a Montreal hotel room (with a full kitchen, nonetheless) after being inspired by all the apples at the Marche Jean-Talon. I hope you enjoy this! Why not try adding some raisins, dried cranberries, or even some almonds to the mix. Serve warm with a scoop of good quality vanilla ice cream.", "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).", "Lay puff pastry onto a round pizza pan.", "Mix apples and lemon juice together in a bowl until evenly coated; add sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.

I tested this recipe with President's Choice(R) Butter Puff Pastry. It is probably the best one you can get, since it contains real butter, whereas some don't. It also comes already rolled out, which is very convenient. I highly recommend using this product. However, if you can't find a brand that's already rolled out, just roll out the standard sized square of puff pastry out to 1/8-inch and you'll be just fine!", "As for the apples, I recommend using a baking apple, such as Idared, Cortland, or Spartan. All of these have produced excellent results. Avoid apples such as Red Delicious, as they are not the best for baking. In this recipe, the apples are still somewhat crisp after baking, giving this recipe some excellent texture."], "nutrition facts": "505 calories; protein 6.4g; carbohydrates 67.5g; fat 24.5g; cholesterol 46.5mg; sodium 169.7mg"}
