It uses frozen milk. It has a decent amount of protein, so I like to put a glass of milk in the freezer a little while before I workout, so it's all ready to make when I'm done. Also makes a great dessert! I like to use natural peanut butter and natural maple syrup. I highly recommend natural grade B maple syrup (it has more flavor than grade A, and natural maple syrup in general is way better than the processed kinds!)", "Pour milk into a plastic bowl and stick in freezer until semi-frozen, about 2 hours.", "Blend milk, peanut butter, and maple syrup in a blender until smooth."], "nutrition facts": "667 calories; protein 28.3g; carbohydrates 56.6g; fat 39.8g; cholesterol 29.3mg; sodium 449.7mg"}
