Hence the name was born. The shake is loaded with healthy fats and fiber to keep you full and energized right through to lunch.", "Blend strawberries, coconut milk, yogurt, flax seed, almond butter, honey, and vanilla in a blender until no traces of yogurt can be seen. Stop the blender and scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula. Continue blending until the mixture is completely smooth, about 1 more minute.", "Please note that this shake is not very sweet. It is meant to keep you full and prevent a crash before lunch from too much sugar. You can use any frozen fruit. Chocolate coconut milk beverage also works great with cherries or strawberries! You can add more honey (or other sweetener) to taste. You can substitute unsweetened coconut milk if you want to reduce the sugar even further. The type of yogurt used really makes a difference, too. Stick to Greek yogurt for the protein, and buy a high quality brand (Fage(R) is my favorite). Any frozen fruit and nut butter work well. The combinations are endless!"], "nutrition facts": "389 calories; protein 14.1g; carbohydrates 46.5g; fat 18.9g; cholesterol 5.7mg; sodium 119.8mg"}
