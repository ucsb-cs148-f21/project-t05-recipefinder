This recipe does not need to be planned in advance, and if I do not have enough cream, I do half cream and half milk.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch pie plate with butter.", "Unroll pastry crust and press against the bottom and sides of the pie plate. Pierce all over with a fork. Cover with a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil; fill with ceramic pie weights.", "Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove pie weights.", "Spread mustard over cooled crust. Cover mustard with flaked tuna. Arrange tomato slices over tuna.", "Whisk cream, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until smooth. Pour evenly over the tomato slices. Sprinkle Gruyere cheese over the egg mixture.", "Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 30 minutes.", "Use dried beans if you don't have ceramic pie weights.", "If you prefer to skip the blind-baking step, you can bake the quiche at a lower oven temperature for 10 minutes more. The crust will pull away from the edges of the pan when it is cooked through.", "Substitute Comte cheese for the Gruyere if desired."], "nutrition facts": "203 calories; protein 14.9g; carbohydrates 12.3g; fat 10.4g; cholesterol 83.7mg; sodium 211.3mg"}
