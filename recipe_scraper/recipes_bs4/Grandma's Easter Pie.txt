When I make this recipe, I omit the pepperoni and use 1.5 pounds of low-sodium ham. Since the ham I use is low-sodium, I do not cook it to remove any salt. Regarding the use of salt, pepper, and parsley in the recipe, go easy on the salt since there is salt in the ham, pepperoni and romano cheese. You can always add a dash of salt to your slice prior to eating if you prefer more. Also, the pepper and parsley should be judged by eye. You don't want too much pepper, but enough to see it dispersed throughout. You can be more liberal on the use of the parsley. It is up to you and your tastes."], "nutrition facts": "380 calories; protein 22.6g; carbohydrates 15.2g; fat 25.1g; cholesterol 125.5mg; sodium 777.1mg"}
