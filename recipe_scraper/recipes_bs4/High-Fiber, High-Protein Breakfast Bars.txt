Line an 8x8-inch baking dish with aluminum foil, letting foil hang down over the sides of the pan; spray pan with cooking spray.", "Stir oats, wheat germ, flax seed, protein powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl.

I use hemp because it is high-fiber. If you use a very sweet powder, I'd suggest lowering the amount of honey. I typically use a brand-name peanut butter inside the bars (Jif(R)), and then all-natural to spread on top. After they are cooled, I cut them into individual servings and cover in plastic wrap for a grab-and-go breakfast."], "nutrition facts": "169 calories; protein 6.2g; carbohydrates 21.3g; fat 7.6g; sodium 148mg"}
