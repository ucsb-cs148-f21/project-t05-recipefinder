Lots of nutrition has been snuck into a bar that is as appealing to kids as to their health-conscious caregivers. I like to store most of them in the freezer and just pull out a few at a time to thaw.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper.", "Combine oats, spelt flour, wheat germ, brown sugar, chia seeds, ground flax seeds, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl.", "Combine applesauce, honey, banana, egg, and dates in a blender; blend until very smooth. Pour over the oat mixture and mix well.", "Scoop granola mixture into the pan. Press down firmly with wet hands to spread evenly in the pan.", "Bake in the preheated oven until very lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 1 to 2 minutes. Cut into bars. Cool completely before lifting from the pan, about 30 minutes.", "If you do not have parchment paper on hand, grease the pan very well before adding the granola.", "I used spelt flour because I like the mild taste and added nutrition, but nearly any flour would likely work, including wheat. For a gluten-free option, amaranth, millet, quinoa, sorghum, and gluten-free oat flours would all work well.", "Things you can add in step 3 include sunflower seeds, dried cranberries, raisins, dried blueberries, or crystallized ginger. My kids' favorite combination is mini chocolate chips and coconut flakes."], "nutrition facts": "157 calories; protein 4.1g; carbohydrates 32.4g; fat 2.1g; cholesterol 11.6mg; sodium 80.6mg"}
