So worth the time it takes to make this. Yummm.", "Soak corn husks in warm water until pliable (About 2 hours).", "Roast corn on grill or under broiler until lightly browned.

If it sinks, it still needs to be beaten more. If it floats, then it is mixed enough. These tamales freeze very well. This recipe is for one meal but I usually make up several batches and freeze them for later use. You will then have a quick week night meal."], "nutrition facts": "397 calories; protein 18.3g; carbohydrates 22.7g; fat 26.4g; cholesterol 173mg; sodium 599.4mg"}
