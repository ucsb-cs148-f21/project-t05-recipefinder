{"name": "Cabbage Roll Soup", "prep": "20 mins", "cook": "50 mins", "total": "70 mins", "servings": "6", "yield": "6 servings", "ingredients": ["1\u2009\u00bd cups converted long-grain white rice", "3 cups water", "1 pound ground beef", "2 cups water", "1 (20 ounce) jar pasta sauce (such as Ragu\u00ae)", "1 (10 ounce) can tomato soup", "3\u2009\u00bd pounds cabbage, cut into bite-size pieces", "1 onion, chopped", "salt and ground black pepper to taste", "1 dash hot pepper sauce"], "steps": ["I made up this recipe after having a craving for cabbage rolls but no time to make them. This is a healthy, hearty recipe. So simple to make and can be adjusted to your liking. You can easily double the recipe and freeze leftovers in portions. Serve piping hot with crusty bread or garlic toast.", "Bring converted rice and 3 cups water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.", "Heat a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot pan until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.", "Stir 2 cups water, cooked rice, pasta sauce, tomato soup, cabbage, onion, salt, black pepper, and hot sauce into beef. Bring soup to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cover. Simmer until cabbage is soft and tender, 20 to 30 minutes.", "You can substitute broth for water. Make this soup as thick or as thin as you like by adjusting the water/broth at the end.", "You can substitute canned diced tomatoes for the pasta sauce if you like it a little chunkier, and if you like even more of a tomato taste, add some tomato paste (but remember to add more water or broth).", "This soup can be made super-quick if you cook and freeze your ground beef in large batches, then just take out what you need. All you are doing is reheating!", "Some like to add sour cream or shredded cheese on top when serving. I love it with hot sauce in my own bowl.", "This can also be made in the slow cooker. It freezes perfectly."], "nutrition facts": "502 calories; protein 22.6g; carbohydrates 75.2g; fat 12.9g; cholesterol 47.8mg; sodium 748.9mg"}
