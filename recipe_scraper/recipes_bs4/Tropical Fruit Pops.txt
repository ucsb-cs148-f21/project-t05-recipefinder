Divide chopped or sliced fruit among 12 frozen treat molds or 4- to 6-ounce paper cups. Pour blended mixture over the fruit.", "Cover each cup with Reynolds Wrap\u00ae Aluminum Foil; make a small hole in the aluminum foil with a knife and insert a wooden stick into each cup through the hole. Freeze about 4 hours or until firm. Remove foil and cup to serve.", "Shape your pops by filling paper cups with fruit and the blended juice mixture. Top with aluminum foil and shape it to the cup, making a small hole for the wooden stick. Aluminum foil is just right for the job because it holds up to freezing temperature and peels right off the pop when ready to serve. Now sit back and enjoy this taste of summer on a stick."], "nutrition facts": "35 calories; protein 0.3g; carbohydrates 8.7g; fat 0.1g; sodium 1.3mg"}
