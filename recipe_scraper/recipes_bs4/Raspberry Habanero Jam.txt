The heat from the peppers and the sweetness of the sugar and berries complement each other perfectly. A simple and unique appetizer or game day snack. This jam is wonderful on top of vanilla ice cream too!", "Blend vinegar, green bell pepper, and habanero peppers together in a blender until smooth. Stir pepper mixture, sugar, raspberries, and pectin together in a large stockpot; bring to a boil and cook until jam is smooth and sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes.", "Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack jam into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings.", "Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars.

Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes.", "Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool.
