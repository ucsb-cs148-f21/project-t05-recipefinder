I admit I never actually tasted a real one before. Always the boxed muffin kind. I loved them. Recently switched to whole wheat, so I wanted to try a new muffin recipe out. This is the one that not only turned out great, but filling as well. When I was eating it, I was craving eggs. Next time I will have to remember to throw in a fried egg or two on the side. I made 6 jumbo muffins.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them to the top.", "Combine brown sugar with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl and spoon the mixture onto the muffins, if desired.", "Bake in the preheated oven until the muffins are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes."], "nutrition facts": "321 calories; protein 7g; carbohydrates 60.1g; fat 7.7g; cholesterol 42mg; sodium 320.9mg"}
