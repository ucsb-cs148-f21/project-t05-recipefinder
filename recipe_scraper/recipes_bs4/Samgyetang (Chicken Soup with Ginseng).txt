Does that make any sense? Well, it didn't to me until I was pestered to try it by my coworkers during my time in Korea. It's a very healthy and invigorating soup made with a baby chicken stuffed with ginseng, daechu (red dates), and glutinous rice, and cooked in lightly salted boiling water. Enjoy with rice and other banchan or side dishes.", "Soak rice in a bowl of water for 30 minutes. Drain.", "Stuff drained rice, chestnuts, ginseng root, and dates into the hen. Sew up the cavity with cotton kitchen twine. Place hen in a large pot and pour in 8 cups water. Add garlic cloves.", "Bring water to a boil; simmer over medium heat, skimming off any scum that rises to the surface, until hen is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes.", "Stir green onions into the pot; simmer until hen is very tender, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season with salt and pepper.", "Use dried or fresh chestnuts as desired.", "Substitute a small chicken for the Cornish hen if desired. You can chop the wings off the chicken, but do not take off the skin.", "You can add more rice to the broth if you like."], "nutrition facts": "281 calories; protein 15.1g; carbohydrates 29.5g; fat 10.8g; cholesterol 75.3mg; sodium 93.9mg"}
