During the Great Depression, this type of dish was a popular strategy for stretching what little meat you had into as filling a meal as possible.", "Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.", "Heat olive oil and butter together in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion with a pinch of salt in hot oil and butter until onion is golden brown and soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove skillet from heat and cool onion mixture to room temperature.", "Place bread crumbs in a large bowl. Add milk and stir with a fork until combined. Let sit until all of the milk is absorbed into the breadcrumbs, 15 to 20 minutes.", "Combine ground chuck, cooled onion mixture, parsley, Parmesan cheese, eggs, 2 teaspoons salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl.

Stir ground chuck mixture until evenly combined.", "Turn chuck mixture out into prepared baking dish, and shape meat into a 3x4x10-inch meatloaf. Pour tomato sauce over the loaf and into the bottom of the dish.", "Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour 10 minutes.
