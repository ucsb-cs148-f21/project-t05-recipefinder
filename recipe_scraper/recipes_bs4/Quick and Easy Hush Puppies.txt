They are generally too dry, too dense, and too bland for my taste. After tasting some in a restaurant that I actually liked, I decided to come up with a recipe of my own. This one deliberately uses stuff right out of the pantry so that it can be whipped up quickly and served fast.", "Mix corn muffin mix, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl until blended.", "Stir eggs and evaporated milk into dry ingredients until moistened.", "Stir cream-style corn into mixture to make a moist batter. Let batter stand while oil heats.", "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).", "Gently drop a teaspoon of batter at a time into the hot oil, staying as close to the oil as possible to avoid splattering. Fry hush puppies until golden brown, about 3 minutes per batch.", "Remove hush puppies with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Sprinkle with salt if desired.", "This recipe is written for the Jiffy(R) corn muffin mix, which is very sweet. If you use another brand the balance of flavors will be off and you will likely need to adjust the seasonings.", "If the hush puppies are not done enough, you can put them in the microwave for 30 seconds to finish them."], "nutrition facts": "176 calories; protein 3.5g; carbohydrates 21.5g; fat 8.7g; cholesterol 30.4mg; sodium 460.9mg"}
