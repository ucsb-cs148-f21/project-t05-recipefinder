They are a variation on the Chinese cha siu bao (Chinese pork buns). I would like to thank Houston Wok for providing Ms. SkimmyJeans' moist filling recipe and Miss Adventure[at]home for a tasty bun recipe. Combined, this is my ultimate banh bao recipe.", "Mix pork, shallots, fish sauce, oyster sauce, and soy sauce together in a large bowl. Let mixture marinate in the refrigerator, about 30 minutes.", "Combine self-rising flour, milk, and sugar in another large bowl; knead until dough is smooth and no longer sticky. Cover dough with cheesecloth; let rest, about 5 minutes.", "Divide dough into 18 balls. Roll out each ball into a circle with a rolling pin on a floured work surface. Place a spoonful of the pork mixture in the center; top with 2 sausage slices and an egg quarter. Gather the edges of each circle together like a coin purse; twist and pinch to seal the bun.", "Cut waxed paper into eighteen 2-inch squares. Place each bun on a waxed paper square. Arrange 1 inch apart in a steamer; cover with lid.", "Steam buns until puffed up, about 30 minutes.", "If dough seems too moist in step 2, add more flour until it no longer sticks to your fingers.", "I'm still trying to find a means of making the buns white. I usually add a tablespoon of white vinegar to the steaming water. However, I don't really see any difference. Others have advised using baking powder. I may try that next time."], "nutrition facts": "277 calories; protein 12.9g; carbohydrates 34.6g; fat 9.6g; cholesterol 65.1mg; sodium 736.4mg"}
