{"name": "Pineapple Upside Down Monkey Bread", "prep": "10 mins", "cook": "40 mins", "additional": "5 mins", "total": "55 mins", "servings": "6", "yield": "1 tube pan", "ingredients": ["2 (16 ounce) cans refrigerated buttermilk biscuit dough", "butter-flavored cooking spray", "\u00bc cup white sugar", "\u00be cup butter", "1 cup brown sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 cup chopped pineapple"], "steps": ["The best and variations galore. We love it!", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup tube pan(such as Bundt\u00ae).", "Unroll and separate biscuits; cut each portion into four or six pieces, depending on your preference. Spray cut biscuits with cooking spray to coat.", "Pour white sugar into gallon-size resealable plastic bag; add biscuits to bag, seal bag, and shake to coat.", "Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat; stir brown sugar and vanilla into the melted butter to dissolve the sugar. Pour butter mixture into the prepared tube pan. Sprinkle chopped pineapple evenly around the pan atop the butter mixture; top with sugar-coated biscuit dough.", "Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 40 to 50 minutes; let cook in pan for 5 to 10 minutes before inverting onto a serving platter.", "Cook's Notes:", "You can just use all brown sugar here if you'd like, but use less if you prefer your treats less sweet.", "Before coating your biscuit pieces in the sugar, you can use melted butter in place of cooking spray, which is the way I prefer it, but the cooking spray will be less fattening.", "Other fruits will work, too. Try apples, mango, peach, or pear. Pear should be sauteed a bit first, as it can be very hard and gritty."], "nutrition facts": "883 calories; protein 10.4g; carbohydrates 115.5g; fat 43.4g; cholesterol 62.5mg; sodium 1666mg"}
