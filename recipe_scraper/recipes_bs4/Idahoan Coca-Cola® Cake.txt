A little alteration here and there (like including Idahoan's Original Mashed Potatoes) to this wonderfully rich cake made with Coca-Cola\u00ae and a new favorite was created.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat the sides and bottom of spring form pan with nonstick cooking spray.", "Melt stick of butter in a large, wide sauce pan.", "Add cola, cocoa powder and superfine sugar and whisk until smooth. Remove from heat.", "Whisk sour cream, eggs and vanilla thoroughly until almost a batter-like consistency and add slowly into the slightly cooled butter mixture.", "Add dry Original Mashed Potato flakes and baking soda. Stir thoroughly. The batter will have a slightly grainy appearance but don't be concerned.", "Pour into spring form pan and bake for 45 minutes to an hour. Test center of cake with a wooden toothpick (cake is done when the toothpick comes out clean).", "Cool and remove from spring form pan. Note: This is a very dark and dense cake.", "Frosting: The cream cheese should be at room temperature. Add cream and powdered sugar and mix in a food processor or with a large whisk. Adjust powdered sugar and cream to ensure a nicely thick frosting that is still spreadable.", "Frost just the top of the cake once it's unmolded and serve chilled. This cake is even better the next day!"], "nutrition facts": "441 calories; protein 5.7g; carbohydrates 48g; fat 26.5g; cholesterol 105.7mg; sodium 451.4mg"}
