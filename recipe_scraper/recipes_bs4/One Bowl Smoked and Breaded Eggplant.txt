I quickly tired of the whole 'salt/wait/rinse' routine of prepping eggplant, and tried it this way. The first time we made this, the hubs asked me what kind of sausage I had used in it as it tastes 'meaty'. We both stared at the empty bowl in amazement as I am not a good cook and this is GOOD! I serve this with sausage or any type of grilled meat. If doubled, it is a meal in itself.", "Heat a large skillet to about 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) or over medium heat.", "Place eggplant in a large bowl and add salt; stir.
