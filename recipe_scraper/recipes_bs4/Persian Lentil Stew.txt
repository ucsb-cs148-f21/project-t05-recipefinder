Earlier this week my husband told me he was craving it so I made my own version of the soup. I tweaked the recipe by adding some herbs and spices not traditionally used in this dish (paprika, red pepper flakes, and red onion). This stew is great for a winter evening or in the summertime served with some tangy yogurt. Enjoy!", "Place lentils in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let soak for 10 to 15 minutes. Drain.", "Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add carrots, celery, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until lightly golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in paprika, turmeric, salt, red pepper flakes, cinnamon, and pepper. Add lentils and olive oil; cook and stir until lentils are coated with oil, 1 to 2 minutes.", "Pour beef broth into the Dutch oven; bring to a boil. Simmer, adding boiling water as lentils absorb the broth to maintain a stew consistency, about 20 minutes. Stir in spinach, lime juice, green onions, and beef bouillon cubes. Continue simmering until lentils are soft, about 1 hour.", "Serve stew topped with spoonfuls of yogurt and fresh parsley.", "Soaking the lentils is not essential but it does help them cook faster.", "Omit beef bouillon cubes for a vegetarian recipe; use vegetarian broth instead of beef broth."], "nutrition facts": "268 calories; protein 16.1g; carbohydrates 39.2g; fat 6.3g; cholesterol 4.2mg; sodium 1385.5mg"}
