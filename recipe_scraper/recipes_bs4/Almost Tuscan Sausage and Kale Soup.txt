{"name": "Almost Tuscan Sausage and Kale Soup", "prep": "15 mins", "cook": "30 mins", "total": "45 mins", "servings": "6", "yield": "6 servings", "ingredients": ["1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed", "1 large onion, chopped", "2 cloves garlic, crushed", "1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste", "1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste", "1 pound bulk hot Italian sausage, removed from casings and crumbled", "\u00bd teaspoon chopped fresh basil", "\u00bc teaspoon smoked paprika (Optional)", "6 cups low-sodium chicken broth", "4 cups chopped kale", "1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed", "1 cup peeled and chopped yellow potatoes, or more to taste"], "steps": ["My boyfriend loves this recipe and even prefers it to the Tuscan soup at a well known restaurant! I adapted this from a diabetic-friendly recipe, if you want to make it that way substitute sweet potato for the yellow potato.", "Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium heat until the oil shimmers; cook and stir onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, and black pepper until onion is translucent, 10 to 15 minutes.", "Mix sausage, basil, and paprika together in a bowl.", "Stir sausage mixture into onion mixture; cook and stir until sausage is browned and fully cooked, 5 to 10 minutes. Add chicken broth, kale, cannellini beans, and potatoes to sausage-onion mixture; lower heat to medium low. Cover stockpot and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.", "To speed cooking time, I usually steam the potatoes while I'm heating the oil and cooking the sausage. That way, I only have to heat the soup 10 more minutes once I mix in the potatoes with everything else. But if you have the patience it's worth it to cook the potatoes the slow way. Also, I love spices so I usually toss in a bit of cumin to cook with the onion and garlic."], "nutrition facts": "329 calories; protein 18.3g; carbohydrates 24.8g; fat 17.6g; cholesterol 33.8mg; sodium 909.9mg"}
