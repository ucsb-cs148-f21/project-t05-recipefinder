They go great with beer, blue cheese dressing and celery. I absolutely love spicy food so if you do too you are in for a treat! If they are too hot for you, milk will help with the heat.", "Combine cayenne pepper, jalapeno pepper, habanero pepper, oregano, salt, sugar, black pepper, and cinnamon in a small bowl; mix well to make dry rub.", "Place chicken wings in a large resealable bag or container. Add dry rub mixture to wings; seal container and shake well until evenly distributed.", "Preheat a grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.", "Cook the chicken wings on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until the chicken is well-browned and no longer pink, 15 to 20 minutes.", "You may want to wear gloves; if the rub gets into your eyes or any open surface it will hurt. I would not recommend letting children play with these spices.", "Depending on taste and size of your wings you may want to make more rub mix or less depending on your taste. Feel free to experiment!", "If baking wings, bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 1 hour. Alternatively, you can deep-fry them."], "nutrition facts": "141 calories; protein 12.6g; carbohydrates 1.9g; fat 9.2g; cholesterol 38.6mg; sodium 234.5mg"}
