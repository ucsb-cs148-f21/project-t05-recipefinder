If you're going to get in to gluten-free baking, tapioca flour is going to be one of your best friends. It has great texture and weight, making a fantastic wheat substitute. In this recipe notice we don't even need a binding agent like xanthan gum? That's the beauty of using cheese!", "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.", "Whisk eggs and salt together in a large bowl with a fork. Stir in mozzarella cheese. Sift tapioca flour and baking powder together over cheese mixture; mix well until cheese softens into the eggs and flour. Add enough milk to make a moist, slightly crumbly dough.", "Dust your work surface with tapioca flour. Scrape dough out of the bowl and knead gently until it begins to feel smooth, about 3 minutes. Shape dough into a log; divide into 4 equal pieces. Carefully roll the pieces of dough under your cupped fingers until round. Transfer to the lined baking sheet.", "Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden, 15 to 20 minutes.", "Adjust the amount of milk you use based on the consistency of the dough: if the cheese you use is fresh, you may not need to add any milk. If the cheese was pre-shredded, it might have lost too much moisture and you will need to add it.", "Since there is no 'gum' used in this recipe, the dough will be fragile. You won't be able to really dig in to it like you would with traditional hand-kneaded bread recipes. Just work it until it's smooth."], "nutrition facts": "302 calories; protein 17.3g; carbohydrates 31.9g; fat 11.7g; cholesterol 129.8mg; sodium 864.9mg"}
