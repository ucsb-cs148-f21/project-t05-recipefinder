Lots of flavor. Great over rice. This recipe is best when the chicken has cooked so long that it looks shredded. It really absorbs the flavors better that way. You could probably substitute beef or pork for chicken. I haven't tried that yet. I'm really interested in seeing what someone with some slow cooking experience can do with this recipe. Could you put everything in a slow cooker and come back to dinner in 6 hours or would the marmalade be a bad idea in a slow cooker?", "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic in hot oil until onion softens, 5 to 7 minutes.", "Increase heat to medium-high, add chicken to onion mixture, and cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes.", "Stir water, soy sauce, and Sriracha sauce into chicken mixture. Reduce heat to medium, cover the skillet, and cook for 30 minutes. Stir marmalade into chicken mixture, bring to a simmer, and cook until chicken is tender and falling apart, about 15 minutes more."], "nutrition facts": "370 calories; protein 33.3g; carbohydrates 41.9g; fat 8.2g; cholesterol 86.1mg; sodium 1387.1mg"}
