This is a great mix of supper foods to bulk up on all those pesky greens we're supposed to consume every day with enough flavor, I didn't need dressing.", "Heat bacon grease in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute Brussels sprouts and garlic until sprouts are slightly wilted and garlic is fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.

Add carrot, Romano cheese, green onions, and hemp seeds and mix well.", "The Kale I used was fresh and tender, thus it didn't need to be cooked to be chewable. This recipe is a starting off point for changing up the usual boring cold salad and adding more variety of greens into your diet. Mustard greens, arugula, collards and more could be substituted.
