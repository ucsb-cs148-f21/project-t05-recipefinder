I was looking for something to cook with chicken, scallions, and Sriracha sauce with an Asian flavor. After about a year of tinkering, this is what I came up with. It can be tweaked to accommodate personal taste on spiciness. Level of heat is akin to hot wings, maybe a step hotter. Everything in this recipe can be changed to suit personal tastes. Serve with steamed rice and any other side dishes you wish. This is how I like to make it for my desired level of spicy. I would love any feedback and information on adaptations that have worked. Thanks!", "Coat the bottom of a skillet with vegetable oil and place over medium heat. Saute chicken in the hot oil until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Add rice vinegar, soy sauce, mustard, chile oil, and Sriracha sauce, adding in exact order and waiting 1 minute between each addition for ingredient to layer.", "Melt butter, stirring occasionally, into the chicken mixture creating a sauce, 2 to 3 minutes; lower heat to medium-low. Add green onions and cook until slightly wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.", "If you want to dial up or down the spice, you'll want to focus on the chile oil and the Sriracha sauce. The chile oil is usually the culprit in making it hot and burn in an unpleasant way."], "nutrition facts": "383 calories; protein 19.7g; carbohydrates 12.3g; fat 29g; cholesterol 104.9mg; sodium 2196.2mg"}
