{"name": "Beer Glazed Brats and Sauerkraut", "prep": "15 mins", "cook": "35 mins", "total": "50 mins", "servings": "6", "yield": "6 servings", "ingredients": ["\u215b teaspoon celery seeds", "\u215b teaspoon caraway seeds", "1 pound fresh bratwurst sausages", "1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle lager beer", "1 tablespoon light brown sugar", "2 teaspoons dry mustard powder", "1 teaspoon onion powder", "\u215b teaspoon ground black pepper", "\u215b teaspoon dried dill weed", "1 pound sauerkraut (preferably barrel-aged), drained"], "steps": ["I came up with this recipe, because simply simmering sausages in beer and onions tasted weak. I was looking for a more intense beer flavor with a little bite, and this is it. A very satisfying dish if you crave German flavor that's Americanized. We love this dish served on potato rolls with spicy hot German mustard, Swiss cheese, and ice cold beer on the side.", "Crush celery seeds and caraway seeds in a mortar and pestle until ground; set aside.", "Place bratwursts into a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Mix beer, brown sugar, dry mustard, onion powder, black pepper, dill weed, and crushed celery and caraway seeds in a bowl, stirring to dissolve brown sugar; pour over the brats. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low; cover and simmer for 10 minutes.", "Uncover and raise heat to medium; boil the sauce until it reduces to a thick, syrupy liquid, about 20 minutes. Tilt skillet to roll brats in the sticky sauce until thoroughly coated. Transfer sausage to a platter and keep warm. Cook and stir sauerkraut in the same skillet to mix in any leftover sauce, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer sauerkraut to a serving platter and top with cooked bratwurst."], "nutrition facts": "296 calories; protein 10.5g; carbohydrates 11.6g; fat 21.1g; cholesterol 45.9mg; sodium 1225.8mg"}
