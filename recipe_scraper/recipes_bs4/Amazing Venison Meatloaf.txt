A super moist and flavorful meatloaf with a 'kick' using venison and pork sausage. It would also probably be good as a leftover, but none of it has ever made it to the fridge so I don't know. This is exceptional when the meatloaf is formed into patties and grilled outside instead of baked in the oven.", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a loaf pan with cooking spray.", "Mix venison, pork sausage, and onion in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Run water from faucet briefly over onion buns, squeeze water out of buns, and break into small pieces. Add pieces of onion buns to meat mixture.", "Stir eggs, brandy, bacon grease, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, red pepper flakes, seasoned salt, garlic and herb seasoning, black pepper, and sage into meat mixture. Transfer to prepared loaf pan.", "Bake in the preheated oven until browned and the juices run clear, 60 to 70 minutes.
