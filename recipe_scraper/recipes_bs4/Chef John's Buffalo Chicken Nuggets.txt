But I like to use chicken thighs.", "Place chicken thighs in bowl of a food processor. Add breadcrumbs, kosher salt, paprika, pepper, seafood seasoning, and cayenne pepper.

Scoop out 24 portions of the chicken mixture with a small ice-cream scoop and place on mat. Cover sheet with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled. (Or place pan in freezer for 15 minutes.)", "Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.", "Place cornstarch, self-rising flour, and salt into a quart-size zip-top plastic bag.
