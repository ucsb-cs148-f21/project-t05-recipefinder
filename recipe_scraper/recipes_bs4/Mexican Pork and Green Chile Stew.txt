It is bursting with flavor, and is mildly-spicy. Serve with hot corn or flour tortillas with butter, or black beans and white rice.", "Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat.", "Spread flour into a wide, shallow dish; add pork and turn to coat, shaking off excess.", "Cook coated pork in hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir onion and garlic in with the pork; continue cooking and stirring until the onion softens, about 5 minutes. Pour diced tomatoes, green chilies, and 2 tablespoons cilantro over the pork mixture; stir. Place a cover on the Dutch oven and simmer the mixture until pork is tender and no longer pink in the center, about 40 minutes.", "Whisk cold water and cornstarch together in a small bowl; stir into the liquid in the Dutch oven and continue cooking until the sauce thickens, 5 to 10 minutes.", "Remove Dutch oven from heat; let dish rest 10 to 15 minutes. Ladle into bowls and top with cheese and desired amount of cilantro to serve.", "This is NOT a very spicy meal (in my opinion), however...if you're planning on cooking it for those with a more 'delicate' palate, you may consider tossing in a couple tablespoons of brown sugar during the cooking (cuts down the heat). You can also serve with a dollop of sour cream on top.", "For those who like extra heat, but not too much, I recommend the La Sabrozita(R) Home Style Salsa Tomatillo. You may also want to serve with traditional white rice and black beans. No need to jazz them up unless you want to. This will make the recipe yield many more servings!"], "nutrition facts": "407 calories; protein 32.4g; carbohydrates 25.5g; fat 19.2g; cholesterol 81.8mg; sodium 436.2mg"}
