Panini get their character or distinct look from the grill marks on the sandwich. I serve it with soup or even salad. This is the basic recipe. Enjoy!", "Drizzle olive oil on 1 side of each bread slice. Spread 1 tablespoon mayonnaise on the other side of each slice. Pile Cheddar cheese, ham, tomato, and onion on top. Top with other bread slice, mayonnaise side down.", "Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat; spray lightly with cooking spray. Place sandwich on grill; weigh it down with a heavy pan. Cook until cheese is melted and grill marks appear, 3 to 5 minutes per side.", "This basic recipe is easily changed up with prosciutto, salami, or even turkey. This is also great as a veggie sandwich.", "You can substitute French bread for Italian bread, if preferred.", "You can substitute extra-virgin olive oil for the extra-light olive oil, if preferred.", "You can use spreadable cheese in place of mayonnaise, if preferred.", "You can use this recipe to make multiple sandwiches; assemble them ahead of time, grill, and place in a warm oven until serving.", "I recommend a George Forman(R) grill because it eliminates the need for flipping. If you don't have a grill pan, use a regular cast iron or nonstick skillet."], "nutrition facts": "802 calories; protein 32.2g; carbohydrates 26.7g; fat 63.2g; cholesterol 117.9mg; sodium 1839.8mg"}
