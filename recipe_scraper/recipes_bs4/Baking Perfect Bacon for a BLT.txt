Perfect for a BLT!", "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).", "Cut a piece of heavy duty aluminum foil about twice as long as a rimmed baking sheet. Pinch and fold every inch or so of the foil to create ridges for the bacon to drain into while cooking.", "Place bacon side by side on the ridged foil.", "Bake in preheat oven to your desired level of doneness and a bit of foam forms on the surface, 25 to 30 minutes.", "Your cooking time is going to vary depending on how thick the bacon is, so I'd start peeking at about 15 to 20 minutes, and go from there. You can crowd the bacon a bit if you need more, and it's okay if it's very slightly overlapping, since it will shrink as it cooks. Just check after about 10-15 minutes, and re-space the pieces if needed."], "nutrition facts": "577 calories; protein 14.6g; carbohydrates 0.8g; fat 56.8g; cholesterol 85.7mg; sodium 1049.6mg"}
