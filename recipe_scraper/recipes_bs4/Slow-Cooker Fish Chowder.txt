Perfect for a winter's day. This recipe is very versatile. I use low-sodium, homemade stock and I find there's enough salt from the bacon that no more is needed. You can change up the seafood, the vegetables, and the seasonings. I find seafood chowder difficult to reheat (a no-no at work!) so I would make this when I have company coming who can finish it in 1 or 2 days.", "Cook and stir bacon in a skillet over medium heat until browned, 5 to 8 minutes; drain excess grease. Cook and stir onion and garlic into bacon until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to a slow cooker.", "Pour chicken stock into slow cooker.
