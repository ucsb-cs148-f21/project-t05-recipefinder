This is the recipe for you! All you need is flour, eggs, salt, and a rolling pin. And, of course, some time to have fun!", "Place flour on a marble or wooden work surface. Make a well in the center and crack in the eggs; add the salt. Gently beat eggs with a fork, incorporating the surrounding flour, until batter is runny. Bring remaining flour into the batter using a bench scraper until dough forms a ball. Mix in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if dough feels too stiff.", "Knead dough with your hands by flattening the ball, stretching it and folding the top towards the center. Turn 45 degrees and repeat until dough is soft and smooth, about 10 minutes.", "Shape dough into a ball. Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour.", "Dust work surface with flour. Divide dough into 3 equal portions. Flatten 1 piece a little and roll out 5 to 6 times with a rolling pin.
