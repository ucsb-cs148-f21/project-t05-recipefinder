Also yummy on crostini with goat cheese; simply brush sliced baguette with olive oil and bake at 400 degrees F until golden brown, spread with goat cheese, and top with the chutney. Delicious! Another great use for the rhubarb chutney is as a topping for pork chops. Season chops (or pork tenderloin) with a mixture of even parts cumin, coriander, garlic powder, and salt, plus a sprinkle of cayenne; grill, then serve with the chutney. It gets raves every time!", "Stir rhubarb, pineapple, water, cherries, sugar, cider vinegar, ginger, garlic, cinnamon, salt, red pepper flakes, and black pepper together in a heavy saucepan; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until the rhubarb is tender to the point of falling apart, 15 to 20 minutes."], "nutrition facts": "114 calories; protein 1.5g; carbohydrates 26.5g; fat 0.2g; sodium 238.1mg"}
