It is fast to make, as no slow cooker is needed. Serve warmed as a substitute for ground beef in tacos, and serve in a taco shell, with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, or other favorite toppings.", "Place chicken breasts into a saucepan and pour in enough water to cover. Place over medium heat, bring to a boil, and simmer until chicken meat is no longer pink, 10 to 12 minutes.", "Transfer chicken breasts to a bowl, allow to cool, and shred the chicken meat with 2 forks.", "Heat vegetable oil in a small non-stick saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir onion until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.", "Mix in the shredded chicken, cumin, chili powder, and tomato sauce; bring to a boil.", "Reduce heat to low and simmer until chicken is hot and the flavors have blended, about 3 minutes.", "Recipe yields 3 servings. Feel free to double it. One pound of chicken is equivalent to 3 small chicken breasts. The sauce will coat the chicken, it will not be sitting in it just like traditional ground hamburger for tacos. If you like it a little saucier, add a spoon of tomato sauce at a time to your taste."], "nutrition facts": "188 calories; protein 29.8g; carbohydrates 1.7g; fat 6.3g; cholesterol 78mg; sodium 174.9mg"}
