The use of celery root, a.k.a. celeriac, was an accident since I thought I was buying a rutabaga but it was an excellent addition.

Great way to enjoy fall and winter produce.", "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).", "Chop parsnips, carrots, celery root, rutabaga, and yellow onion into 1-inch pieces and place in a large sealable container.
