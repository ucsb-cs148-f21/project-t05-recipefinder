Serve with a generous green salad. I like something with strawberries or Asian pears and a glass of white wine. Make it a full meal by topping with a dry-spiced chicken breast (I like a hint of fish oil and garlic spice blends to make a nice rub.)", "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.", "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir fish sauce, chile paste, and garlic in the hot oil; cook and stir until the garlic softens, about 5 minutes. Add bell pepper, olives, capers, and oregano; continue cooking and stirring until the garlic browns, about 5 minutes more. Pour drained linguine into the sauce; toss to coat. Top with black pepper.", "The chile paste I use by Sisters Secret Gourmet Foods(R) is a local product in Vancouver, BC and was featured on Season 4 of the CBC TV Series, Dragon's Den.
