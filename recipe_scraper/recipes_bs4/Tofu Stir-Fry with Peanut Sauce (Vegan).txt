It's healthy, filling, and full of flavor!", "Whisk coconut milk, peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, sriracha sauce, and ground chile powder in a bowl until a smooth sauce forms.", "Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrots and red bell pepper; saute until just tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tofu; saute until lightly browned, about 4 minutes per side. Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.", "Pour sauce into the skillet; stir to coat tofu, carrots, and bell pepper. Cook until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low; stir in spinach 1 cup at a time until wilted. Serve over brown rice.", "The best way to drain tofu is to freeze it ahead of time, then let it defrost on paper towels to soak up the water. If you don't have time to freeze it, carefully squeeze it between your palms over the sink and let it drain on paper towels until you're ready to cook. The more you drain ahead of time, the faster it will brown in the pan.", "This recipe works just as well with chicken. You can also use different kinds of peanut butter to get different flavors and textures of sauce."], "nutrition facts": "441 calories; protein 16.7g; carbohydrates 39g; fat 25.9g; sodium 648.6mg"}
