The best! This recipe has been used in my family for at least 6 generations. The results more than make up for the long, labor-intensive prep and proofing process. There are hundreds of these in our kitchens and dining rooms around the holidays! The anise gives a very distinctive licorice-like flavor. If someone tastes one for the first time and doesn't like it, I take the rest of the cookie and eat it so it doesn't go to waste. I actually don't bake long enough for the cookies to turn brown.", "Beat confectioners' sugar and eggs together in a large bowl until thick.", "Place anise seed in a bowl. Pour water over anise seed into bowl and let mixture sit to steep, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat anise mixture and lemon zest into egg mixture.", "Sift flour and measure again.
