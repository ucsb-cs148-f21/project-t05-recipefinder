They are delicious and keep very well. This recipe makes a lot, so you might want to cut it in half. Add dried fruit and chocolate chips to suit or dip in melted chocolate when cool.", "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease.", "Beat eggs together in a bowl until thick and lemon-colored. Gradually add sugar to eggs while continually beating. Pour oil into egg-sugar mixture and beat until smooth. Mix gluten-free all-purpose flour mix, rice-based flour mix, baking soda, and xanthan gum together in a separate bowl; gradually stir into egg-sugar mixture until dough is well-mixed and sticky. Fold almonds into the dough.", "Turn dough onto the prepared baking sheet and form into 2 loaves, 1/2-inch thick and 2 1/2 inches wide.", "Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Cool loaves on the baking sheet for 2 minutes; slice into 1/2-inch slices. Lay slices, cut-side down, on baking sheet.", "Bake in the oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer biscotti to a wire rack to cool completely.", "I use half Bob's Red Mill(R) and another rice-based flour mix. Bob's Red Mill(R) is a bean-based flour and I like the texture it gives the biscotti. If your flour mix already has xanthan gum added, you can omit. It needs to have a total of 2 teaspoons xanthan gum per 3 cups of flour. I add 1 teaspoon because my rice mix contains xanthan gum, but the Bob's Red Mill(R) doesn't.", "Vanilla extract or almond extract can be used in place of the anise seed, if desired."], "nutrition facts": "92 calories; protein 1.7g; carbohydrates 11g; fat 5g; cholesterol 11.6mg; sodium 83.5mg"}
