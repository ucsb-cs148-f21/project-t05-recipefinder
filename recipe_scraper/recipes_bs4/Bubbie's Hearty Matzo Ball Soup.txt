Some family members say it started with our great-great-grandmother Bubbie Rose. My husband, her great-great-grandson, has put his own twist on it by adding extra vegetables and fresh dill which we think sets this soup above the rest. This soup is so good, there's no reason to wait until Passover to enjoy it.", "Place chicken into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until chicken meat is very tender and falling off the bones, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove chicken from pot and pick chicken meat from bones when cool enough to handle, discarding skin and bones. Shred chicken meat.", "Bring chicken broth to a boil in a large soup pot; stir shredded chicken meat, carrots, celery, turnip, parsnips, leek, onion, and dill into broth. Turn heat to low and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.", "Stir matzo ball mix, eggs, vegetable oil, and 1/2 cup water together in a bowl. Form mixture into 1-inch balls using wet hands to prevent sticking. Return broth to a boil and gently drop matzo balls into the boiling soup. Reduce heat again and simmer soup until matzo balls have increased in size and are cooked through, about 20 more minutes.", "You may adjust the amount of vegetables to create a soup that is more or less hearty. The soup is very flavorful as is and always tastes better the next day. Also, if you love dill, you may consider adding some to the matzo meal before forming the balls."], "nutrition facts": "410 calories; protein 25.4g; carbohydrates 30.7g; fat 20.6g; cholesterol 139.7mg; sodium 1504.4mg"}
