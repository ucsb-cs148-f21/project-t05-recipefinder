So here's mine! I previously had trouble with whole wheat pie crusts; they tended to be hard to work with and crumbly. Then I added wheat gluten, as I do for bread, and voila! This makes enough for one 8-inch pie. If you're making a recipe that requires a top and bottom crust, double the recipe.", "Mix 3/4 cup flour, gluten, and salt together in a bowl. Cut shortening into flour mixture using a pastry blender until mixture is crumbly. Mix 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon water into the flour mixture using your hands until dough easily forms a ball; add more water if needed.", "Flatten dough into a pancake-like shape on a floured surface; sprinkle top of dough liberally with about 1 tablespoon flour. Roll dough, using a rolling pin, into a thin pie crust about 1-inch larger than your pie pan. Roll the crust onto the rolling pin and transfer to the pie pan.", "If you are making this for a pie that requires that the crust be baked before anything is added, form and crimp the edges of the crust, pierce liberally with a fork to prevent large bubbles from forming, and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 30 minutes."], "nutrition facts": "166 calories; protein 4.8g; carbohydrates 22.8g; fat 7g; sodium 147mg"}
