It's also a bit more piquant than the classic version and uses more cheese (because more cheese is always good). To make it more decorative in the bottle, try adding large sprigs of fresh basil to the dressing after shaking it. Makes a nice gift, and fresh basil tastes better, too.", "Mix olive oil, Parmesan, garlic, mayonnaise, vinegar, bread crumbs, sesame oil, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, chili powder, black pepper, basil, hot pepper sauce, salt, oregano, paprika, and cayenne pepper in a shaker or bottle with a lid; shake vigorously.
