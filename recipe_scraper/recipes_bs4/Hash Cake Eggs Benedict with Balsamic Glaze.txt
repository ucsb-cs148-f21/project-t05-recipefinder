The glaze and hollandaise can be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator until ready to use. You can prep the cakes the night before and cook them in the morning. Also, if you are uncomfortable poaching eggs, fried or scrambled eggs would work too!"], "nutrition facts": "429 calories; protein 14.9g; carbohydrates 22.6g; fat 32.5g; cholesterol 376.6mg; sodium 434.1mg"}
