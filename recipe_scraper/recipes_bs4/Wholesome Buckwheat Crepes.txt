Soaking the groats before using them develops a lovely texture and a delicious, soft nutty taste. After blending you end up with a smooth batter. These crepes do not crisp up and become golden but they are very pliable and go great with maple syrup, berries, jam, and mashed bananas as filling.", "Combine buckwheat groats with about 1 1/3 cup water in a bowl; allow to soak, draining and rinsing once or twice during soaking, 4 hours to overnight.", "Rinse and drain groats one final time. Transfer drained groats to a blender with egg, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and 1/2 cup water; blend into a smooth batter. Blend more water into the mixture as needed to reach a smooth, spreadable texture.", "Lightly grease a skillet and place over medium heat.", "Pour about 1/3 cup batter into the skillet; lift and tilt the skillet to swirl the batter evenly over the skillet; return to heat.", "Cook for about 2 minutes. Gently flip the crepe and cook the other side until the crepe is firm in the middle, about 2 minutes more; flip again and cook about 12 seconds.
