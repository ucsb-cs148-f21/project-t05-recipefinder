What makes this recipe so good is the endless ways that you can season it. It's also easily converted for a very large amount. I have made it for as little as my husband and I all the way to a group of 80 for my son's engagement party. Use Greek, Old Bay\u00ae, seasoned salt, garlic powder - endless possibilities.", "Dissolve chicken bouillon in water in a bowl.", "Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir vermicelli pieces until golden brown, about 5 minutes.", "Pour bouillon mixture into the skillet with the vermicelli.", "Stir rice, black pepper, salt, and Greek seasoning into the vermicelli mixture and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low; simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.", "This recipe also works well using instant rice. Follow the recipe exactly, only use the amount of water and rice called for on the instant rice box. Just allow it to sit a bit longer than called so that the vermicelli has time to soften.", "This also works well using beef broth or bullion.", "If you prefer a moister rice, add a bit more of water. If you like a drier rice, put a little less water."], "nutrition facts": "357 calories; protein 6.7g; carbohydrates 54g; fat 12.5g; cholesterol 30.6mg; sodium 1122.7mg"}
