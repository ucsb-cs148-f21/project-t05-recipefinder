Crunchy on the outside with a tender middle, you'll swear they've been fried!", "Combine 1/2 cup warm water and 1 teaspoon sugar in a bowl; add yeast. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 10 minutes.", "Mix flour, 2 cups water, butter, and salt into yeast mixture and stir until smooth. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.", "Stir 1/4 cup sugar, vanilla extract, and baking soda into flour mixture until batter is smooth.", "Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter, about 1/4 cup per waffle, onto the griddle until waffles quit releasing steam, about 10 minutes.", "Start out with a bowl that seems ridiculously big for the batch of ingredients, as the final batter will rise immensely, and could likely overflow on your counter. Big mess.", "The key to preserving the crisp waffle texture while eating is not to cover it with your toppings at the beginning. Keep the waffle plain, cut a bite off, and dip into your topping instead."], "nutrition facts": "204 calories; protein 3.6g; carbohydrates 28.8g; fat 8g; cholesterol 20.3mg; sodium 303.3mg"}
