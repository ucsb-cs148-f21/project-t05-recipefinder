This was simply amazing. We are at our lake house for the summer and our friends came over. I had a super busy day and while at the butcher deciding what to make, the pork butt looked amazing. I did serve this dish with a creamy polenta. I am Italian! What can I say... if you want to keep it paleo, then serve with sauteed vegetables or sauteed garlic spinach (I do that a lot). This freezes well and taste even better the next day! You can also prepare this meal in your slow cooker.", "Season pork with kosher salt and pepper.", "Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat; add oil.
