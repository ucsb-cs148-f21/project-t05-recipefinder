Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the quinoa has absorbed the chicken broth, about 15 minutes.", "Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook and stir the chicken breast pieces in the hot oil until no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes. Stir asparagus and red bell pepper into the skillet and cook and stir until barely tender, about 3 more minutes.", "Lightly mix cooked quinoa into the chicken and vegetables until thoroughly combined, heat for 1 to 2 minutes, and serve.", "Oddly enough, you can substitute two 10 3/4-ounce. cans of chicken noodle soup for the chicken broth. Just remove the noodles (and use for another purpose) and use the soup as you would the chicken broth to cook the quinoa. This is even more flavorful than using just chicken broth."], "nutrition facts": "284 calories; protein 23.6g; carbohydrates 28.9g; fat 7.7g; cholesterol 45.6mg; sodium 47.5mg"}
