Literally. I turn into a 3-year-old, crying, sniffling, ranting things like, 'My hair will never grow back!' So, when I met Nikki over a decade ago, I've stuck to her like how Bon Jovi groupies have stuck to the oh so fab Jon. On my recent visit with Nikki, I learned that not only is she an ace stylist, she apparently is the keeper of Thai cooking secrets. I'm usually dozing when Nikki is doing her hair magic\u2026 the reason why I didn't know this sooner. Anyway, Nikki shared her mom's ground chicken cooking technique for Larb Gai.

Pour enough water into the skillet to cover the turkey; bring to a boil. Cook and stir turkey mixture, breaking the meat apart with a fork, until turkey is browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes.

I prefer brown.", "This can be served as an appetizer or tapas-style. Don't forget the lettuce and mung beans on the side.", "Boiling the turkey instead of stir frying it keeps it moist and helps the turkey absorb all the beautiful flavors that is Larb Gai."], "nutrition facts": "266 calories; protein 24.9g; carbohydrates 21.3g; fat 9.8g; cholesterol 83.6mg; sodium 630.5mg"}
