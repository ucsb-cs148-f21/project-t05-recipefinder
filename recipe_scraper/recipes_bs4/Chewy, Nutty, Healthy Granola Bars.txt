They're very easy to make and you can pack in everyone's favorite nuts and fruits. My family has now stopped buying Kashi\u00ae and chewy bars because we love these so much. These are gluten-free when made with rice flour and appear to be professionally made thanks to the small spoonful of corn syrup that keeps everything tightly combined and gives the bars a nice shine. Have fun experimenting with different combinations of nuts, dried fruits, and toppings! Almond butter works well, too!", "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking dish.", "Stir peanut butter and melted butter together in a bowl until smooth. Add brown sugar, honey, corn syrup, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt; stir.
