Remove from heat and mash berries using a potato masher.", "Line a sieve with cheese cloth; place over a large pot. Pour mashed berries through cheese cloth-line sieve; let sit until all liquid has drained through cheese cloth, about 30 minutes. Stir 1 pound sugar per 1/2 gallon of drained blackberry juice.", "Bring blackberry juice and sugar to a boil in a pot; cook until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Skim off any residue accumulated on top.", "Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack hot saft into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top.

Top with lids, and screw on rings. Store in refrigerator.", "You can always add more sugar, but never take it back out.
