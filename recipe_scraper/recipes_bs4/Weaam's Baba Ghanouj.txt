Prick the skin of the eggplant in several places and place on the baking sheet.", "Roast eggplant in the preheated oven until tender and skin is blistered and blackened, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool until easier to handle, about 10 minutes.", "Cut the eggplant in half, scoop out the pulp and cut into pieces. Discard any seeds.", "Mash garlic and salt into a paste using a mortar and pestle.
