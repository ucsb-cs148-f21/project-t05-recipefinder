Sophisticated enough to serve at brunch, this quiche also fits right in as finger food at summer picnics. We especially love it when most of the ingredients come from our farm share and we use fresh eggs from our neighbor's chickens. Friends who initially raised their eyebrows at Swiss chard not only request I make it, they ask for the recipe. Serve warm or at room temperature.", "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).", "Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in melted butter until soft, about 7 minutes; transfer to large bowl.", "Blend eggs, milk, Jarlsberg cheese, and Parmesan cheese in a food processor or blender; pour into bowl with the onion.
