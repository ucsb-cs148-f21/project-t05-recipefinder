Batter will be elastic and stringy, but will fill out the ring as it cooks. Cook the crumpets until golden brown on the bottom and bubbles form on the top side, 5 to 8 minutes. Increase griddle temperature to 230 degrees F (110 degrees C) and flip the crumpets. Cook until underside is golden brown, 2 to 3 more minutes.", "Remove rings from crumpets, grease the rings and griddle again, and turn griddle heat back down to 220 degrees F (105 degrees C).
