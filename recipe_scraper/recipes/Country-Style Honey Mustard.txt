(Alternatively, use a blender, rolling pin, mortar and pestle or a small food processor. The key is to crack the seeds to release the flavor.)", "Stir together cracked seeds, mustard powder, Dr Pepper\u00ae, honey, salt, thyme, and turmeric (if using) in a bowl. Cover loosely and set aside for 10 minutes for a very spicy mustard or up to 1 hour for a more mellow mustard.", "Add vinegar, stirring thoroughly. If a smoother consistency is more to your liking, puree the paste and vinegar in a blender until smooth. (The mustard will thicken as it sits; don't worry if it seems loose.) Divide equally among prepared jars, allowing 1/2- to 3/4-inch of headspace in each jar.", "Cover the jars and let stand at room temperature for 2 days before using. This curing period removes any remaining bitterness, smoothing the edges. Mustard can be stored without refrigeration for months.
