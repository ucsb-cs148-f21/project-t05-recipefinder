This sauce infuses the flavor of artichoke and sun-dried tomato along with fresh tomatoes, cream, and a hint of sweet wine to please all. Serve over pasta of your choice. Shrimp, scallops, or mussels work very well with this sauce!", "Cut all the leaves away from the artichokes to expose the hearts.", "Trim the artichoke stems, and scoop out the fibrous center with a grapefruit spoon or small paring knife.", "Mince 1 artichoke heart, and coarsely chop the second. Set the artichoke hearts aside.", "Place the roma tomatoes, round tomatoes, and tomato sauce into a blender; pulse several times to mix, then blend the mixture until pureed, about 30 seconds.", "Pour the tomato mixture into a large saucepan, and stir in the tomato paste and garlic until smooth.", "Heat over medium heat, and stir in the artichoke hearts, 1/2 cup of sun-dried tomatoes, Italian seasoning, oregano, marjoram, and salt.", "Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.", "Pour about 1/2 cup of the simmering sauce into a small bowl, mix in the liquid smoke and 1/4 cup of sun-dried tomatoes. Stir this mixture back into the saucepan.", "Pour the heavy cream, sweet white wine, and Parmesan cheese into the sauce and stir to combine. Bring the sauce back to a simmer, and cook until the cheese has melted, about 10 minutes. The sauce should be a pink color with red patches from the sun-dried tomatoes.", "The use of liquid smoke flavoring reduces preparation time by not requiring the need to fire-roast the tomatoes. While fire-roasting is not needed, the added flavor is desired.", "The use of a sweet white wine reduces the need for sugar and also provides a nice flavor from the wine. Wine substitution: the addition of 1 teaspoon of sugar or to taste is recommended. I prefer the flavor of the wine to be subtle; no harm in adding another 1/4 cup!"], "nutrition facts": "344 calories; protein 5.2g; carbohydrates 14.6g; fat 30.8g; cholesterol 110.2mg; sodium 711.6mg", "link": "https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/220001", "db": "2 whole artichokes 4 roma (plum) tomatoes, seeded and chopped 6 large round tomatoes, seeded and chopped 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce 4 ounces tomato paste 1 clove garlic, minced \u00bd cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes (Optional)3 tablespoons Italian seasoning 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon dried marjoram 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring (Optional)\u00bc cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes (Optional)4 cups heavy cream at room temperature \u00bc cup sweet white wine \u00bc cup grated Parmesan cheese "}
